							<h1>KINGDOM COVENANT REWARD SYSTEM (PART 2)</h1>

									<h3 style=color:red>Daily Reading: James 4:1-3 </h3>
									<pre><code> <b style=color:red>M.V: Matt. 7:8</b> <br />                         
For every one that
asketh receiveth; and
he that seeketh
findeth; and to him
that knocketh it
shall be opened.</code></pre> 

									<p>
We shall consider the basis for asking and receiving today. In Matthew 7:8 our Lord Jesus Christ simply tells us to ask and receive. From that level of information it would appear that receiving is automatic upon asking. Yes, it can be but we need a revelation of how it can be.
									</p>
									<p>
First in Matthew 21:22 our Lord Jesus Christ went further to say: “And all things, whatever you shall ask in prayer, believing you shall receive.” So, faith commands the reward for prayers but how do we receive the answer? Many people labour in the theatre of prayer and have not prevailed through their travailing. Prayer has become a mere habitual spiritual exercise for some people. From our Bible text today, we are required to ask with pure motive. God knows our needs but many times we ask for what we want rather than what we need. What we want are the things we want to consume upon our lusts, for self pleasure. That is an area to watch.									</p>
									<p>
The scripture also teaches us to ensure that our desire in prayer aligns with God’s will for our lives. I John 5:14 reads: “And this is the confidence that we have in Him, that, if we ask anything according to His will, He heareth us.” So, our prayer must pass the test of alignment apart from motive. You would have observed that God does not answer all our prayers. If He does, there would have been mass burials in many parts of the African continent where the dominant prayer is always that the enemy must fall down and die. Why don’t we ask the Lord to render the wicked powerless by destroying their weapons as we stand upon scriptures like Isaiah 54:17 and Job 5:12 and ask Him to turn the counsel of the enemy to naught as He did for David and then watch God bring His judgment on the wicked. Moses did not kill Pharaoh, David did not kill Saul, Mordecai did not kill Haman, Hezekiah did not kill Sennacherib, Baby Jesus did not kill Herod. Yet, in all these cases, God personally executed death sentence on the wicked.									</p>
									
									<p>The last issue we shall consider today as it relates to prayers is the revelation from Jeremiah 33:3 where God says He will answer our prayers by showing us certain things. Sometimes, we need to pray and ask God to show us the way out of some challenges rather than ask God to give us something. We need wisdom to pray. Rejoice in the Lord.</p>
