            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Mal. 2:2</strong> <br>                         
If ye will not hear, and if 
ye will not lay it to heart, 
to give glory unto my name, 
saith the LORD of hosts, I 
will even send a curse upon 
you, and I will curse your 
blessings: yea, I have cursed 
them already, because ye do 
not lay it to heart.</code></pre>

				<p>Gratitude is the force behind praise. Without gratitude, thanksgiving does not flow. All believers are created as praise addicts and every genuine believer would say ‘thank you’ to Jesus a few times daily. I have a friend in Orlando, Florida, in U. S who says that times without number per day and it is good. The more we praise God for what He has done just as we worship Him for who He is, the more we shall see His goodness. My mentor once said that he is so blinded by the goodness of the Lord that he does not see anything the Lord has not done well. It is good to find a reason to praise God at all times for we are created for His praise (Isaiah 43:21). And that is what we shall be doing eternally in heaven when we
meet the Lord. So it is good to begin to praise God at all times just as the psalmist declared in Psalm 34:1.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Our God is sovereign and He does as He pleases. The only thing He demands from us for all His innumerable benefits is praise. Praise is so important to God if we consider our memory verse together with Deuteronomy 28:47, 48. Each time I read this later scripture, I become afraid. The Lord is God. There is none else beside Him. The wisest thing to do in life is to keep finding out what He wants and to keep doing it. Praise brought down the walls of Jericho. Praise brought victory to Jehosaphat and Judah against a multinational army. Praise caused an earthquake to shake the prison for the release of Paul and Silas. Praise is potent.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The gratitude which we express in praise is a proof of contentment. Gratitude means to be grateful for where we are today by the mercies of the Lord. And God is faithful. If we praise Him for how far He has brought us, He will see to it that He takes us further in our journey to experience the glory of His wonders. Bountiful harvest may be delayed or missed altogether if we do not commit ourselves to praising God. The Lord of the harvest has all power to keep away the little foxes that may want to eat up our vines. He can stop the emptiers and He can shut the door against the slave–drivers and the task masters. He multiplies our harvest as we praise Him. Praise will accelerate the overflowing blessing which He has promised us. Praise can also terminate an era of delay in bringing forth our harvest. Rejoice in the Lord.
