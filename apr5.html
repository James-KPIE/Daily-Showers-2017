            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Job 5:27</strong> <br>                         
Lo this, we have searched 
it, so it is;
hear it, and know 
thou it for thy good.</code></pre>

					We are still considering the issue of the uniqueness of each person standing before God. The truth is that our God is a ‘personal’ God and salvation is very, very personal. Indeed, our Lord Jesus Christ
told us no less in His closing message in Matthew 24. He made it clear that when the day of the Lord shall come, two people may be on the field and one will be taken and the other, left out (v.40). Indeed, the wife may be taken and the husband left behind or vice-versa. In other words, each of us must work out his or her salvation with fear and trembling. Salvation is not corporate, so also will be the final journey to eternity.
				</p>
				
				<p>
The fallout of the reality of the personal audience God always has with each of us is not ousted when God sends a message to the generality of a people. You will recall that God decided to show mercy to the family of Lot in Sodom during the destruction of that city, because of Abraham. The message from the angel was that they should not look back as they were running out to escape the destruction of Sodom. However, Lot’s wife did the contrary and she became a pillar of salt. <b>When God speaks to a crowd, each person must hear the message for himself. Each of us must decide on what to do with what God has said.</b> The kingdom reward is personal. The instruction of the Lord to Moses for the Passover night was for all the children of Israel in Egypt. God made up His mind to deliver them from hundreds of years of slavery that night. Thank God they all obeyed the instruction to mark the lintel and the two side posts of the doors to their houses with the blood of the lamb. If any of them had failed to do so, he or she would have suffered the loss which the Egyptians suffered.
				</p>
				
				<p>
The words which God speak to all must be taken serious for our individual destinies. Why? The word of God says God shall return and make a distinction between the righteous and the wicked, particularly those who serve Him and those who serve Him not (Malachi 3:18). When God speaks, you and I must hear Him for ourselves. What each one does with God’s message is up to him or her. And that is what shall determine where we spend eternity. He who ignores God’s word does so at his own risk. Rejoice in the Lord.
