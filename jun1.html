            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Psalm 104:1-24 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Ps. 104:30</strong> <br>                         
Thou sendest forth
thy spirit, they are
created: and thou
renewest the face
of the earth.</code></pre>

				The obvious answer to the question in the topic for today is: no one. However, as real as it is, one cannot prove it by the understanding that even the Christians display. Every person who rejects divine instruction is telling God that he is wiser than He
(God) and that is the truth. When a husband is instructed to love his wife, that instruction is the wisdom of God. If, for any reason (any many husbands have their many reasons), he does anything that is less than love his wife, he has turned the order between him and God, he has told God that he is wiser than God. The same is true for a wife who will not submit to or respect her husband in the spirit of humility. It means the wife is saying to God <blockquote>‘God, please keep Your Word; I’m wiser here.’</blockquote> And this is our attitude, brothers and sisters. However, it ought not to be so.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				For about three years I stayed on the internet, reading from several commentators across the globe, especially from the United States and the West, so many comments on issues such as abortion, gay marriage, refugees acceptance and more. I found that many people have subjected the word of God to all manners of interpretations that take away the fear of God from the heart of men. In the name of love and to be inclusive, they say we must not mention those attitudes and sins which the Lord clearly, condemns in His word. If God says a particular sin will not allow a person to get to heaven, is there any need to debate it? The best way to show God’s love to those who err is to tell them the truth in love. We are not to condemn anyone because we cannot help God. Nevertheless, we cannot, for the purpose of assimilation and the necessity to avoid hurting people, twist the clear word of God in order to make the sinner happy. If we do that, being ministers of God we cannot escape the judgment of God. I can never find justification for gay marriage in the Bible. And if anyone wants to go that way, he is very free, absolutely free to do it outside the church of the living God. Since the beginning of creation, it was clear that God created us as males and females and that marriage is between a man and a woman (Genesis 2:24).
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We must continue to pray for individuals and nations who, through unbridled permissiveness, have turned the word of God upside down and forgotten the very foundation upon which their nation was built. The farther we move away from God‘s holy instruction, the more certain the ultimate eternity in hell becomes. He that has ears let him hear. Rejoice in the Lord.
