            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Romans 5:8-17 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Rom. 8:19</strong> <br>                         
For the earnest
expectation of the
creature waiteth for
the manifestation of
the sons of God.</code></pre>

				<p>
				On the first day of this month we started to consider the mind of Christ and one of the opening statements on that day was that as Christians we have no existence apart from Christ. Transformation is the essence of regeneration. We are transformed into new beings
through redemption. A saved soul is a new person. Yes, he may not
have a new physical appearance but his mind is transformed because the old nature of sinfulness is gone with the wicked works of darkness and new nature of holiness with purity of heart and cleanliness of the hands is in place as we put on Jesus Christ according to Romans 13:14.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				To put on Jesus Christ is to receive the mind of Jesus. The new life which the believer lives in Christ according to Paul the apostle in Galatians 2:20 begins when we renounce sin through repentance and acknowledge Jesus Christ as our Lord and saviour. We were all sinners in Adam as we saw two days ago. Through the sin of Adam every man has sinned. Even a day old child who is born naturally as an innocent baby is already tainted by the sin of Adam and spiritually the child is a sinner. A man is a sinner not because he sins; a man sins because he is a sinner. That is the truth about the sinful nature. Those who are made righteous through the atoning death of our Lord Jesus Christ are righteous not because they cannot commit sin or because they never committed sin but because the righteousness of Christ is imputed unto them. That is why Paul who participated in the killing of Stephen could say in Acts 20:26 that he was not guilty of the blood of any man. That is the mystery of redemption. <b>If a man be in Christ, he is a new creature, old guilt is passed away and he is clothed with the righteousness of Christ.</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				To enjoy the new life in Christ we must allow the mind of Christ to dwell in us and influence all that we do. From tomorrow we shall consider other features of the mind of Christ with a view to unveiling the personality of the new believer so we can know whether we are conforming unto His death, that is whether the dead works are dying in us for until the evil works of darkness are removed from our heart, we cannot witness the manifestation of the fruits of the Holy Spirit. Our personality in Christ can only be defined by the fruit of the Holy Spirit which shows forth in our lives. We are only Christlike when all of Christ is all that we manifest. Rejoice in the Lord.
