            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: 2 Kings 6:8-18 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: 2 Kgs. 6:23</strong> <br>                         
And he prepared great 
provision for them: and 
when they had eaten and 
drunk, he sent them away, 
and they went to their 
master. So the bands of 
Syria came no more into 
the land of Israel.</code></pre>

				We shall now consider the various ways to deal with delay in our circumstances. Whenever we tackle the reason for our delay, our journey gains speed without much effort. For example, we saw how Abraham experienced a turnaround after he separated from Lot because Lot was the cause of his delay in receiving further instructions and blessings from God. In like manner, if a Christian has experienced stagnation in his spiritual journey and suffered delay in
receiving answers to his prayers due to unforgiveness, things will turn around when he forgives those offenders. Our focus today shall be on how to deal with those we call the arresters.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Arresters are spiritual or physical forces that may hinder a person from making progress in life. There are external arresters and there are internal arresters. We shall consider the external arresters first. The armed soldiers who were sent by the king of Syria to arrest Elisha were external arresters. If they had succeeded in arresting the prophet that may mark the end of his ministry and his life. If he was jailed, there will be irrecoverable delay in the accomplishment of whatever God would have him to do. May be the siege on Samaria would have led to an invasion of the city with the dwellers all taken as captives. May be the woman of Shunem would have missed the miracles she enjoyed after the famine and so on. But Elisha used the anointing of God upon his life to arrest the arresters and to prematurely checkmate the harassment of the arresters.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				There may be enemies around you who for no reason may desire to hinder your advancement or delay your progress. They are just uncomfortable that you are at peace and making steady progress. This may occur in the working place or even in the home. There was a young school girl who was becoming famous in Western Nigeria many years ago. She had emerged the fastest runner in one of the provinces in that old region and all eyes were on her as a potential star for Nigeria in tracks events. Then suddenly she died. Everyone was shocked at her death. Her father later confessed that he killed her because she was becoming too famous. That is what is called household wickedness. It is very safe to pray that the Lord should destroy all the wicked forces of your father’s house. Powers of darkness are real. You will be a fool to deny their existence. The wise thing to do is to cry to God to stop all forces that are determined to hinder your progress in life. Pray to God to arrest all the arresters of your destiny. Rejoice in the Lord.
