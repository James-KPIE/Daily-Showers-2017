            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Acts 17:22</strong> <br>                         
Then Paul stood in the
midst of Mars' hill, and
said, Ye men of Athens, I
perceive that in all things
ye are too superstitious.</code></pre>

				<p>
				Religion has been the obstacle to many people’s salvation. They have a form of godliness but it lacks the power to transform their lives or position them to live a life of victory. Many people are born into one religion or the other. They are comfortable and feel a sense of being religious as long as they perform certain rites or carry out certain
obligations. After a process of time they may be conferred with some titles in the church where they worship but they have never had an encounter with Jesus wherein the Holy Spirit convicts them of their sins and the conviction compels them to seek the Saviour of their soul, Jesus Christ the Redeemer. Such people, according to the Bible, don’t have their names written in the book of life. The book of life contains the names of those whose live are redeemed by the blood of the Lamb (Revelation 13:8).
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Jesus Christ did not come to the earth to pioneer a religion. He came to set free the captives of sin and to reconcile the sinful man to the holy God. A person may be religious all his life time without knowing Christ or getting saved by His blood. There are people who have obtained such degrees as ‘Doctor of Divinity’ who have no saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. Theology does not save anybody. In fact some people have gone farther away from Jesus Christ and salvation because they study theology. Our Lord Jesus Christ is a relational God. Isaiah 9:6 calls Him the mighty God. Some religious people may tell you that Jesus Christ is not God because of their limited understanding of who Jesus Christ is. He is God the Son who is co-existing, co-powerful, co-redeeming and co-eternal with God the Father and God the Holy Spirit. They are inseparable. Read Acts 10:38 again and see how the Holy triune God work together. The Holy Spirit empowered Jesus Christ for the exploits which He did as the Father worked with Him.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Religion is a burden. Religion makes a man to run several kilometers while staying at the same spot. Religion gets a man to feel satisfied with himself whereas God is not satisfied or pleased with him. God is only pleased with you when the righteousness of Christ is imputed unto you through salvation and when you put on Jesus Christ in character (Romans 13:14). Have you been religious without knowing Christ? Today is the day of your salvation. Jesus Christ wants to become your Lord, Saviour and friend. Don’t hold back. Embrace Him and surrender your life to Him. He has been waiting for you. Rejoice in the Lord.
