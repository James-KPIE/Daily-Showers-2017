				Success flows from the covenant of blessing. In Psalm 1:3 the word of God says that whatsoever the righteous does shall prosper. Blessing always waits for the work which the righteous person engages in. In Proverbs 14:23, the scripture again says that in all labour there is profit. It is the impartation of blessing that cancels all sorrow which the enemy plans for each
of us. That is why Proverbs 10:22 says that the blessing of the Lord makes one rich and does not permit sorrow to come in. Those who are covenantly connected to the covenant of blessing through Christ can enjoy the fruit of their labour and ignore the plans of the wicked because the Lord will only permit the enemy to watch us without being able to hurt us, according to the testimony of David in Psalm 23:5.<br /><br />
Joseph prospered in all that he did. The enemies of his destiny conspired to push him into their perceived territory of irrelevance but his glory could not be swept aside. As a slave, he prospered, not because of his title or his environment but because of the covenant of blessing that rested on his head. Everyone who positions himself or herself well under the covenant can prosper. In the prison, the supernatural influence of the blessing again spoke in the life of Joseph and he was a success in every little assignment he had to do. When his success rate became visible, the prison authorities put him in a position of authority. When the covenant is operational in your life because you are well–connected to the root of Abrahamic covenant, you don’t struggle to be noticed and you would not need to lobby in order to be promoted. For the righteous who walks in the covenant, promotion comes only from God (Psalm 75:6). We should not seek promotion from mere men because when our way pleases the Lord, He can turn the heart of the king to favour us (Proverbs 21:1).<br /><br />
To prosper in the things that we do requires that we be totally dedicated to God and to honour God with our first fruit while not failing to lay down the tithe. The tithe is an acknowledgment of God as our Source and only a foolish Christian will ignore his source. The covenant of blessing caused Joseph to prosper in all he did and may that be your testimony too. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
