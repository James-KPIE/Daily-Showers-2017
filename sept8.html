            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Exodus 14:1-14 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Ex. 14:13</strong> <br>                         
And Moses said unto the people, 
Fear ye not, stand still, and 
see the salvation of the LORD, 
which he will shew to you today: 
for the Egyptians whom ye have 
seen today, ye shall see them 
again no more for ever.</code></pre>

				Whatever God does is always completely done. No one needs to add anything to the completed work of the Almighty. And He never begins a project which He will not complete. God has no abandoned project. He is the great finisher who finishes whatever He starts in grand style. When this our awesome, mighty and powerful God also fights our battles, He fights to ensure that there remains nothing that will make the enemy to afflict us again. That is why God was angry with King Saul when he did not wipe out all that God commanded to be killed in
Amalek. Elisha was also annoyed with the King of Israel in 2 Kings 13:19 when the king struck the ground only three times and stopped (v. 18). The man of God said: <blockquote>“You should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck Syria till you have destroyed it. But now you will strike Syria only three times.”</blockquote>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The Egyptians had urged the Israelite to leave Egypt when the Lord moved mightily against Egypt and killed their first born sons on the Passover night. The Lord was not yet done with the stubborn Pharaoh whose heart he had hardened so He might destroy him. So, Pharaoh led his army on their chariots to begin a hot pursuit of the Israelites who were unarmed and were leaving his territory. The foolishness of Pharaoh became God’s opportunity to destroy the Egyptian soldiers led by Pharaoh. Moses spoke by the inspiration of God that from that day the Israelites would see the Egyptians no more. The end of the Egyptians came when the Lord buried them under the red sea
				</p>
				
				<p>	
God is consistent in fighting battles to finish. In 2 Kings 6, the Assyrian soldiers were on a mission to arrest Elisha. But it was Elisha who arrested them by the power of the Holy Spirit. He instructed the king to feed the arrested arresters and to give them water to drink and to set them on the way to their master to show their master the power of the Most High who can make men who carry lethal weapons to become redundant and their weapons impotent. In verse 23, the Bible says: <blockquote>“So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.”</blockquote> It was a permanent solution to the threat of the Egyptians and the nightmare of the Assyrians.		
<br /><br />		
Our God is the God of permanent solution. Trust in Him absolutely and your conquest shall be absolute. Rejoice in the Lord.
