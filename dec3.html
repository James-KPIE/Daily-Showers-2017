            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Matt. 11:1-12 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Matt. 11:12</strong> <br>                         
And from the days of John 
the Baptist until now the 
kingdom of heaven suffereth 
violence, and the violent 
take it by force.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				It is the inexhaustible and unparalleled riches of the kingdom and its blessings that cause the true believer who has tasted heaven on earth to want to hold unto the kingdom without letting go. From now till the end of this year we shall be sharing testimonies of transformation and victories from children of God which they experienced because they are kingdom
citizens. For good measure, taking the kingdom by violence means to resent all means by which the adversary may want you to compromise your kingdom citizenship and loyalty. We must resist the philosophy of the age and the satanically inspired interpretations of God’s word which have breathed all kinds of permissiveness unto this world. Jesus Christ’s reference to the confrontative style of Elijah and John the Baptist points to the violence of opposing the culture of immorality and corruption that has pervaded this world.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				In His valedictory message, especially in John 17, our Lord Jesus told the Father that His disciples are in this world but not of the world. Pressing unto the kingdom violently is not about political or military warfare but it is expressed in spiritual warfare. We resist the advancement of the kingdom of darkness through prayers. For example, all parents must engage in spiritual warfare to shield and protect their children from the easy life of softness towards sin and easy-believism of our age. In many communities especially in the advanced world, children are not to be disciplined in order to correct them when they are wrong. If any parent does that and it comes to the knowledge of the authorities, the parent will be jailed. So, children of very young age are left to themselves. Plus, educational institutions have been freed from having to impact any religious instruction unto students in schools. Christian parents in such societies must wage spiritual warfare to rescue their children from the hold of Satan. That also requires violence in the spirit –to refuse to surrender the destiny of your children to the devil.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The upheaval caused by the kingdom of God is the result of God’s order shaking relationships, households, cities and nations by the entry of the Holy Spirit’s power working in us. In Luke 16:16 our Lord Jesus Christ said “The law and the prophets were until John. Since that time the kingdom of God has been preached, and everyone is pressing into it.” It takes an intentional pressing to stay sanctified unto the Lord our Saviour, to read the word daily and to do those spiritual exercises that will preserve our souls in God’s kingdom. We must all press against the tides of the end time to make it to heaven at last. Rejoice in the Lord.
