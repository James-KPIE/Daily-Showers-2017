            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Psalm 96 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Luke 17:16</strong> <br>                         
And fell down on his
face at his feet, giving
him thanks: and he
was a Samaritan.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				Most of us would not be qualified to worship the Most High but for grace. Our memory verse for today emphasizes the fact that the leper who returned to worship Jesus was a Samaritan. You will
recall that it was a Samaritan who had compassion on the man who was attacked by robbers on his journey from Jerusalem to Jericho. (Luke 10:29-36). A priest and a Levite had passed by that victim of robbers without showing any care for the man.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Jesus Christ came to open the gate, which the law had shut against the Gentiles, through grace. In John 4, Jesus had passed through Samaria in order to reach out to the people who were traditional enemies of the Jews. He broke the boundary to bring salvation to those who were kept ‘outside’ the temple by tradition, by the anger of the Jews. The Jews were the natural descendants of Abraham who had embraced Judaism both in tradition and as a religion. Under their laws, worship was reserved for those who followed their religion and customs but Jesus came to break those barriers. That is why Galatians 3:28 -29 says that there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus and if you are Christ’s then you are Abraham’s offspring and heirs according to promise. Jesus Christ is the seed of Abraham according to verse 16 of this same chapter. The covenant which God entered into with Abraham was a covenant of grace, not a covenant of law. Therefore, the laws of the Jews which came 430 years after that covenant of grace, could not nullify it. Anyone who believes in Christ with his or her heart according to John 1:12 has the enablement of grace to offer acceptable worship to God.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Worship is an act of spiritual righteousness. Under the law, one could hardly qualify to worship God, in view of the standard which no man had the capacity to fulfill (see James 2:10). The violation of just one of the ceremonial laws of Moses would make you guilty of all the other laws. So, you will return to offer sin offering, trespass offering and many other offerings and these were eternal acts which had no bearing with the state of the heart. However, faith in our heart and the purging by the blood of redemption qualifies us for worship without any discrimination. Rejoice in the Lord.
