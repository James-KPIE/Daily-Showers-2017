            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Rev. 2:2</strong> <br>                         
I know thy works, and
thy labour, and thy
patience, and how thou
canst not bear them
which are evil: and thou
hast tried them which say
they are apostles, and are
not, and hast found them
liars:</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				Grace does not exclude works. We are not saved by our works but we are saved to work. Paul the apostle makes that clear to us in 1 Cor. 15:10 thus <blockquote>“But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace towards me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.”</blockquote> The benefit of grace is that as we put on the righteousness of Christ we are able to do such things that we wouldn’t have been able to do without grace. For example, we are told to work out our salvation with fear and trembling
(Philippians 2:12). We do that by aligning our lives with the will and purpose of God, consciously ensuring that we yield to the prompting of the Spirit of God rather than to the dictates of our flesh. If we say we have obtained grace and will therefore do nothing, we will lose the grip of our lives in Christ.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				To the seven churches in the book of revelation, our Master emphasized the issue of works. In Rev. 2:2, 2:9, 2:13, 2:19, 3:1, 3:8 and 3:13, Jesus Christ said to each of the churches that “I know your works.” We are saved to serve. And that is why our Lord and Master is much concerned with our works – whether they are dead works that will be consumed by His fire or whether they shall not be burnt when such works are tested. Unfortunately many Christians believe that they are saved by the blood of Jesus to be happy. There is something greater than happiness in redemption. Although happiness is a by-product of the joy of salvation, fulfillment is our ultimate goal in salvation. And we have no fulfillment until we have received the final commendation of the Father saying to us ‘well done true and faithful servant,’ enter into the joy of your Lord. To be a servant is to serve. We cannot afford to remain as sons and daughters alone. We shall only be rewarded as servants. We are already enjoying the benefits of sonship - the power and the blessings.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Are your hands full or empty of work in the Lord’s vineyard? In what part of the kingdom business are you involved? Are you daily praying for souls to be saved and making conscious effort to introduce Jesus to every sinner that comes your way? Begin to work now so that your grace is not received in vain. Rejoice in the Lord.
