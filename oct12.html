            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: 1 Kings 17:8-16 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Job 42:10</strong> <br>                         
And the LORD turned the 
captivity of Job, when 
he prayed for his friends: 
also the LORD gave Job 
twice as much as he 
had before.</code></pre>

				Self–absorption is a negative attitude that causes delay in peoples’ lives. <b>Those who are selfish place a limit on the speed of accomplishment in their lives.</b> A selfish person thinks of himself alone and often ignores the big picture. If a selfish person is rich, he may think the world revolves around him alone and expects that literally everybody would think the way he thinks and he expects
everyone to submit to his will and subscribe to his views. A selfish person hardly seeks the good of others and by so doing restricts the opportunity for his own enlargement. Since it is the liberal soul that shall be made fat, a selfish soul shall shrink. The selfish person may not reach the maximum of his potentials for greatness and enlargement even though he is apparently doing well.
<br /><br />
We see the demonstration of true spirit of liberality in the widow of Zarephat in a most unlikely situation. The widow had only one meal left for herself and her son to live upon till they would die. Then the man of God came and demanded that the woman should make a meal for him first. Elijah dared the faith of that woman but grace helped the woman to respond without being selfish. Things turned out the exact way the prophet had said they would be. There was no scarcity in the house during the remaining period of the famine. The season of scarcity would have been prolonged in that house but for the liberal spirit of the widow.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				A few days ago we considered the subject of the breakthrough seed. We observed that if there is a delay in the release of the breakthrough seed, the person who desires a turnaround may wait a little longer. Heaven responds to our actions here on earth. We have the privilege to provoke heaven for our desired intervention. But if we do nothing to instigate heaven, there will be silence in heaven. If your breakthrough is waiting for a seed from your hand, you may labour in vain on the altar of prayer to see the manifestation that you desire. Imagine that the widow of Zarephat had embarked on a fasting programme and she had continued to pray and yet she had refused to accede to the request of Elijah when he came. Her lack would have lingered and she and her son would have died of hunger.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The shortest route to ending a delay in your circumstances is to seek the Lord’s face as to what you must do and respond without delay. The last meal of the widow became the first again because she responded by being liberal. We can learn from her. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
