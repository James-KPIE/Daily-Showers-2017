				<p>
					We shall spend one more day on the power of one meal. In our Bible passage for today we read the story of Elijah and how God fed him with one meal that provided strength for him for forty days and forty nights. This was a supernatural meal from God’s own kitchen in heaven. In the book of Psalms, we read of the people of
God who ate the food of angels. God provided manna from heaven for the Israelites until they got to the boundary of the Promised Land (Exodus 16:35). On April 7, we read about one Egyptian who was found by David and his company of soldiers while they were in search of the Amalakites that had plundered Ziklag. The young man was in distress and all David had to do was to give him a meal that revived him. The Egyptian became a key to the eventual turnaround that the army of David experienced. One meal made the difference. We shall concentrate on spiritual meal today.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Our spiritual meal, apart from the Holy Communion meal, is the word of God. In Ezekiel 3:1-3, the Lord asked His servant to eat the scroll which was the word of God. The LORD caused him to eat it and he ate it, and it was in his mouth as honey for sweetness. Jeremiah gave a similar testimony in Jeremiah 15:16 where he also ate the word of God and it became joy and rejoicing in his heart. The word of God is for our consumption. We are as strong as the Word of God that is richly deposited in us. If we ignore the Word, we have ignored spiritual strength. Our discoveries in the Word of God are the ingredients that reinforce our confidence in God and serve as revelations for our elevation. Show me a Christian, who is not filled with the word of God, I will show you a lightweight Christian. What many of us don’t realize is that the devil also knows whether we are empty or filled with the word of God. A man who is loaded with the Word of God is a terror to the devil. You are as strong as the Word of God which you carry. Every iota of faith you will have will have to be processed from the Word of God.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I have heard of many Christians who run from place to place looking for miracles. The miracle seed is right in your hand. It is the Word of God. There is nothing we need or desire in life that is not in the Word of God. Go back to the Word of God and begin to consume it for spiritual nutrition, strength and victory in all areas of your life. Rejoice in the Lord.
