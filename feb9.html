							<h1>GIVING BRINGS INCREASE</h1>

							<!-- Text -->
								<section>
									<h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>						<h4 align="right">Thu. Feb.9, 2017</h4>
									
									<h3 style=color:red>Daily Reading: Luke 6:38 </h3>
									<pre><code> <b style=color:red>M.V: Prov. 11:25</b> <br />                         
The liberal soul shall
be made fat: and he
that watereth shall be
watered also himself</code></pre> 

									<p>
Our Lord Jesus Christ told us that the reward of increase is automatic for those who give. Just like the law that makes the harvest bigger than the seed sown, the increase that follows giving
according to our Lord Jesus Christ, is more than geometric. It is simply supernatural. It defies human explanation. However, as in the other cases we have just considered under the kingdom covenant reward system, we need to have more revelation on how giving must be done to command the reward of increase. We shall consider at least three conditions today.
									</p>
									<p>
The first condition is that giving must be done willingly done from our heart. When the offering for the building of the tabernacle was to be taken in Exodus 25:2, God specifically commanded Moses to take the offering from those whose hearts were willing to give such an offering. God does not ask for offering from people who grumble. I have told brethren once and again that it is willingness of the heart that commands increase upon our giving. God looks into the heart of the giver to see whether the heart backs up the hand that is stretched forth to give.									</p>
									<p>
Unless the heart is willing, the giving cannot meet the second Biblical standard which requires that our offering be done cheerfully. Once again God checks to see whether the heart is merry beyond the cheerful expression on the face of the giver. Willingness in giving is emphasized in Exodus 35:5, 21,29; 1Chro. 29:9, 17 and 2 Cor. 9:7.									</p>
									
									<p>
									The third factor in enjoying the increase promised by God when we give is the need to look away from how God would do His own work, which is to cause increase to flow unto us. Unfortunately, some brethren want to help God by using their brain to calculate how it will happen. God’s ways are not our ways. His ways are higher than ours. We cannot think for Him. Our attitude should always be like the boy who gave his lunch in John 6 and got out of the way. Once we bring our offering unto the altar with joy, delight and cheerfulness from a willing heart, we should trust God to do what He has promised. I preached on Luke 6:38 sometime ago and a man with little faith told the person who sat next to him “who will give to me?” He said it sarcastically. He could not imagine that anyone would give to him. I can’t imagine why any Christian should think that way. Let us do our part and leave God to do what He alone can do. He is faithful. Rejoice in the Lord.
									</p>
