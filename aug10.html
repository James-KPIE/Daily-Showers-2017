            <h4 align="right">Wed. Aug. 10, 2017</h4>
            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Matt. 6:25-33 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Matt. 6:33</strong> <br>                         
But seek ye first the
kingdom of God, and
his righteousness;
and all these things
shall be added unto
you.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>We shall continue on the line of thought from yesterday’s exhortation. All blessings flow from God the Creator of heaven and earth. Indeed, Abraham recognized God as the Possessor of heaven and earth and he openly declared his absolute trust in and his total dependency on Him. While we were considering our heritage in Christ some days ago, we recalled that the
number one law of supernatural prosperity is to recognize God as our Source. Abraham knew this as he said in Genesis 14:23 that he would not give any mortal man the opportunity to say that he made him (Abraham) rich. David corroborated that position in Psalm 23:1. When you are addicted to the kingdom of God and the business of the kingdom becomes your priority, your needs are taken care of by the kingdom such that those things which people are dying to get will be added to you without struggle.

				</p>
				
				<p>Our Lord Jesus Christ warned us not to give way to worry and anxiety over our common daily needs as the unbelievers do. Worry is an expression of unbelief. It is distrust in God’s ability to take of His own people. That is why it is sin when we consider Romans 14:23. God is our sufficiency in all things. He is more than enough for us. That is why we must continue to think as kingdom citizens because we are no longer earthly-limited. We need to run our lives by the heavenly mentality which is built on the word of God. As citizens of heaven, we no longer walk by sight but by faith. There is no scarcity in heaven and God is enough for us. There are thoughts that should have a permanent grip on our heart which is the base of our faith. When that is settled, we will be able to operate at the level where Jesus wants us to.
				</p>
				
				<p>Our Lord Jesus tells us to seek the kingdom first. This means we should make the matters of heaven our priority. We observed in yesterday’s sermon how we should make the kingdom our number one prayer. We can add to that by saying that we must also consider kingdom investment-putting our resources into kingdom projects and programs a matter of priority. That will make our own needs to become God’s priority in heaven and He guarantees that what others are running after and for which they are losing their lives, will be additions for us. It is the short way to where we are going. Rejoice in the Lord.
