            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Eccl. 3:1-12 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Ecc. 3:1</strong> <br>                         
To every thing there is a
season, and a time to
every purpose under the
heaven:</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				The Psalmist tells us in Psalm 31:15(a) that our times are in God’s hands. That means we cannot ignore God in the usage our time. Indeed time does not belong to us. As I said some days ago, we are users of all things that God created, God is the owner, we are not the
owner because we don’t have the power of the one who owns it. If we own time for example we will be able to adjust it to our own convenience, shorten or lengthen it and manipulate it to serve our exact purposes. We will even dictate the time we shall do things and the time we shall die. All those things are not in our power and we cannot cause to happen what the Lord does not permit for a specific time. In James 4:13-15, Apostle James tells us that the power over what happens tomorrow is not in our hands. He says the best we can do is to plan and seek God’s will for its execution within the time-frame we desire.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				As kingdom citizens we ought to be wise to seek God’s mind for our purpose in life so we do not waste the most precious asset God has made available to every person – time. God is so gracious that both the wicked and the righteous have the same number of hours per day. Indeed, according to Matthew 5:45, He causes the sun to rise upon the evil person as well as the good person and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. The difference between the righteous and the unrighteous as far as time usage is concerned is that what the righteous does with time would add up to a sure end for him whereas the investment of the time of the wicked will end in regrets. That is what we can infer from Isaiah 3:10-11. So, it does not matter whether anyone knows what you are doing with your time now – whether at work or in the after-office hours or when you go on escapades when you are supposedly away on an official assignment – everything will add up to something for you, for God is the judge.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Those who are addicted to the kingdom maximize their time in such a way that it yields benefits to the kingdom. They have an allocated time for the altar in the early hours of the day just as Abraham used to do (Genesis 19:27). We saw the same habit in Daniel two days ago. Then there is time to read the Bible, and then there is time to intercede for your nation, your church, your family and other individuals on your prayer list. Every kingdom addict has prayer list per time for life. When your heart is in a thing you will always create time for it. You must have time to share the gospel with the lost too as often as you meet them. Make your time count. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
