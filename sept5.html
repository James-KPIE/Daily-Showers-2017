            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Genesis 1:1-12 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Gen. 1:3</strong> <br>                         
And God said, Let 
there be light: 
and there was light.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				God specializes in providing solutions to the problems of man. From the dawn of creation, He commenced the work of providing remedies so that wherever we have some deficiency, He makes available His sufficiency. This is very important for every believer because Hebrews
11:6 tells us that those who come to God must believe that He is. God is who He says He is.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The first problem with the earth was that it was formless at the beginning and everywhere was dark. Wherever darkness is, there is confusion and knowledge will be lacking. Darkness is, therefore a symbol of ignorance and ignorance leads to destruction (Hosea 4:6). On the other hand, light produces life and it shatters darkness. And that was evident in the solution which God brought to the formless nature of the earth. He commanded light to appear and there was light everywhere. Things began to take shape as soon as there was light. From that first solution, God continued to create other things and everything He created was to solve a particular problem or meet a specific need. For human survival, water, vegetation, animals and other things that God created have different roles to play and God set everything in order, creating what man would need first before man was created. Adam had no shortage of anything when God created him.
				</p>
				
				<p>	
It is important to appreciate God as the God of solutions and worship Him as such. It has been proved, and I am a witness, that God will be to you who you believe Him to be according to His word and especially what you call Him as you worship Him. For example, in my family, we recognize God as God of unending opportunities and God of inexhaustible blessings. That is what we call Him in that area of our lives and that is exactly who He has proved to be to us. He told the Israelites in Numbers 14:28: “So tell them that as long as I live–consider this to be an oracle from the Lord–as certainly as you’ve spoken right into my ears, that’s how I’m going to treat you” (ISV). Who is God to you and what do you say into His ears daily? Our Father in heaven is a personal God. You can walk closer to Him and enjoy Him in deeper acquaintance through worship. Do you have challenges that seem to overwhelm you? Turn them over to our great solution provider and believe Him. His nature does not change. He is still solving problems as He did at the creation. Rejoice in the Lord.
