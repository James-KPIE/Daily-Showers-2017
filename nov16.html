            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Matt. 9:35-38 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Matt. 1:21</strong> <br>                         
And she shall bring forth
a son, and thou shalt call
his name JESUS: for he
shall save his people
from their sins.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				Jesus Christ is the savior of the world from their sin. He is not the savior of Christians alone. Indeed it is after a sinner is saved from sin by the cleansing blood of Jesus that he or she becomes a Christian. To be a Christian is not simply by being born into a Christian family. It is not by associating with a church or by being religious in
certain denominational activity. Although these are popular perceptions about who a Christian is but Biblical truth is that a Christian is a person who is Christlike in character through regeneration by the saving blood of Jesus our Lord. It is against this background that our Lord Jesus Christ warned us that on the judgment day many people who have paraded themselves as Christians including those who had done miracles in His name would be rejected.
<br /><br />
In the spirit of 1 Samuel 16:7, God would search our hearts and not our faces or our dressing to determine who are real Christians that will make heaven. <b>This whole emphasis has become necessary because there are folks who should have surrendered their lives to Christ and be born again but they set boundaries against their own salvation because they claim they belong to another religion. Nobody is going to make it to heaven on the basis of any religion (Christian religion inclusive) if the person is not saved by the redeeming blood of the lamb.</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The mind of Christ perceives the multitudes that we see all around us as sheep wandering around without a shepherd and that is the truth. And unless we have this understanding from the words of our Lord Jesus Christ we will not be awake to evangelism and soul-winning as believers. Our natural assumption is to look at a man or a woman who looks gentle and innocent and would not hurt a fly and think he is okay. Such a person may be your friend, neighbour, co-worker or even your blood relation. If he or she has not received Jesus Christ as his or her Saviour, he is a gentle man or a polite lady going to hell. Many people are around us who look happy but their souls are empty and troubled. They have a void inside of them which only Jesus Christ can fill. Unfortunately, when we neglect to bring these people to Christ, the devil hijacks their souls and they will begin to run errands for him.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Every sinner around us is a potential saint because every saint was a former sinner. You are a saint to whom the righteousness of Christ is imputed when you are redeemed by the blood of Jesus. It is our responsibility as end-time harvesters to seek the unsaved, pray for their salvation and engage them in salvation conversations. Someone somewhere labored for our salvation. You must do so for others too. Rejoice in the Lord.
