				Peace or all–round rest is our portion in the blessing covenant. Abraham was a man of peace. He was peace–loving and ready to pay the price for peace. He led an army of 318 servants to rescue Lot and other people who the enemies had
breached the peace in their community and taken away. When Lot covetously chose the watered plain of Jordan for his own cattle to graze, Abraham did not contend with his nephew over the stretch of land. Rather, Abraham gently conceded that land to lot even though he (Abraham) would have to do extra work to feed his cattle. To maintain peace with other people requires a readiness to make sacrifices, and where necessary, to suffer.<br /><br />
The covenant of peace assures us of rest in the face of earthly troubles and challenges. We may not have a trouble–free or challenge–free life but because God has given us rest, we can always surrender our pressures to God who will graciously give us His pleasure. To abide in peace requires that we trust in God absolutely so we can remain unmovable when life’s heat beams on us. Father Abraham did not lose his peace. He took his challenges with philosophical calmness. He bowed before a community of people who were not as famous or as rich as he was. He respected people irrespective of their status on the earth. Abraham was ready to be at peace with everyone around him.<br /><br />
When we operate the covenant of peace, we live with a very large heart. To accommodate the shortcomings of other people and to accept people the way they are, to believe in who people can be and give them a chance for that reason rather than shut the door against them because of who they are presently, requires a heart that values peace. If we do not cherish the peace which we have in Christ who has connected us to the covenant of peace, we will quarrel everyday or find faults with people every day. Whenever people show their ugly side to you, don’t be too quick to judge or condemn them. With a heart of peace, help them to see where and how they are wrong and if they are not ready to understand your point of view, give them some time off as you pray to the Holy Spirit to help them. In all cases, avoid malice and never engage in Unforgiveness. To live in peace is to be ready to pay the price for peace. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
