            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: 1 Kings 17:8-16 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: John 16:13</strong> <br>                         
Howbeit when he, the Spirit of 
truth, is come, he will guide 
you into all truth: for he shall 
not speak of himself; but 
whatsoever he shall hear, that 
shall he speak: and he will shew 
you things to come.</code></pre>

				<p>We shall continue from where we stopped yesterday. In Isaiah 48:17, God tells us that He is the One that teaches us to profit. Another version says He is the Lord who teaches us to succeed. Now, the word teaches connotes the passing of instructions or to impart knowledge. But how can a student learn if he is ordinarily deaf. That will be a major obstacle in learning, without doing more. It is the presence of the Holy Spirit in us that opens us up to hear the voice of God. God is Spirit and the flesh cannot relate with Him (John 4:23-24). You and I need the
Holy Spirit. Elijah the prophet would have died prematurely when the brook from which he was drinking dried up if he had not heard further instructions from God. Divine intervention is the pathway to divine intervention.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Back to Abraham’s experience in cooperating with God to end the delay in his family having children. How did he see God in the three men who were passing–by on that afternoon? He had spiritual perception. In Genesis 18:2, he ran towards them and worshiped. That alone is a pre–cursor to divine visitation. Everyone who worshiped Jesus in the Bible including a leper and a mad man got a miracle. So, the worship by Abraham set the pace for a divine encounter. In verse 3, he called the three ‘my Lord.’ Abraham knew who he was dealing with. Then, in order to operate within the timing of the divine agenda for that visitation, the 99 year old began to do strange things. In verse 6 he hastened, in verse 7, he ran. That was an old man running. There is a West African adage that says when you see an old man running, it is either he is pursuing something or something is pursuing him. Abraham ran in pursuit of destiny. Many Christians have missed blessings because they were too slow to respond to divine opportunity. Haven’t you heard someone said ‘oh, and I felt a nudging to do so and so… He or she did not follow through and a miracle or a blessing was missed. <b>The widow of Zarephat also got her miracle because she seized the moment.</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Abraham did not spare all the people around him in making that strange meeting a successful event. In verse 6, he told the old woman Sarah to make measures of meal ready quickly. In verse 7, he instructed a servant to hasten to prepare meat from a tender calf. You see all that Abraham went through on that day? Many Christians literally fold their hands and expect miracles to happen. But Abraham did his own ‘natural’ so God could do His ‘super’ and the result was a manifestation of the supernatural act of God. Embrace opportunities as they appear. Rejoice in the Lord.
