            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Psalm 95 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Psalm 95:6</strong> <br>                         
O come, let us
worship and bow
down: let us kneel
before the LORD our
maker.</code></pre>

				<p>
				There is a link between our understanding of who God is and how we worship Him. The worship which many Christians engage in is too casual and at times, flippant. The dictionary defines <b>flippant</b> as ‘frivously, disrespectful, shallow or lacking seriousness,
characterized by levity.’ That is the exact way in which the worship of even some ministers of the gospel can be described. I have been to churches where pastors leave the ‘young ones’ and the congregation to praise and worship God because the pastor is the boss. In a few cases, the time of praise and worship is a good opportunity for the pastor to finish a pending assignment in the church office. It shows how much understanding these ministers have of God, and the degree of esteem which they hold Him in.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				In our memory verse, we are called to come and worship God and bow down and kneel before the Lord our Maker. In verse 7 of Psalm 95, the Psalmist further explained why we should take that posture in worship. He wrote: “For He is our God, and we are the people of pasture, and the sheep of His hand.” Those who are wise would acknowledge the Lordship of God over their lives and even the kingdom business which they preside over. Things have gone so bad that some men of God earn the worship of their brethren. My mentor once said that if men worship you, they will wash you away. In some cases, our members fear us much more than they fear God and would tremble before us in a fashion that they would not before God. Only God is to be worshipped and adored. We should also always remember to point to God as the One to whom all glory belongs, for every accomplishment of grace in the things that we do.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Human beings are funny. Many of those who are too big to worship God today did not start that way. They would jump and dance and crawl before the Almighty God before their breakthrough came. After that, they relax and by doing so, fall into the temptation of the enemy. Some of such people have become history while they are still alive. The lesson from yesterday’s sermon is helpful here. If you have received your breakthrough through holiness, purity and prayer of faith, it can be sustained through humble worship so that you will not have a better yesterday in your journey in Christ. God’s plan is to show Himself great in all you are doing and to increase you more and more (Psalm 115:14). You can experience that through worship. Rejoice in the Lord.
