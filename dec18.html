            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: 2 Cor. 6:1-10 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: 2 Cor. 6:1</strong> <br>                         
We then, as workers
together with him,
beseech you also that ye
receive not the grace of
God in vain</code></pre>

				Life in the kingdom, while we are still on this side of eternity, is not all pleasure, nether can it be. Our Lord Jesus Christ warned us severally and told us to get ready for the pressure of persecution because this world dwells in darkness and darkness will always hate light. Every child of God who wants to live a sanctified kingdom life should prepare for
opposition and all kind of attacks because this world dwells in evil. Both in the Old Testament and in the New, those who stood on the side of the Lord always had tough times in the hands of the enemies of righteousness. Shadrach, Meshac and Abednego were thrown into the fiery furnace because they refused to worship the gods of Babylon. Daniel had to face the lions in their den because he would not forsake Yahweh in daily worship and prayers.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Today there are subtle pressures of persecution and direct, frontal attacks against believers because of who we believe in. In some nations like Nigeria, Christians don’t have the same right of expression of worship as others even in institutions of higher learning in some parts of the country. Such fundamental human rights only exist in the constitution even though such institutions are federal institutions. Many Christians have had to voluntarily resign appointments due to frustration in lopsided promotions where merit is forsaken due to all manners of religious discrimination. This piece is not written in protest over violated rights. No. It is written to get you prepared for greater persecutions of the end time. What about the brutality of maiming and killing of Christians right in the place of worship!. It was after serious prayers that those children of anarchy who have sold their souls to Satan began to kill the people of their own religion in their orgy of violence. They shall eat their own flesh and drink their own blood, says the word of God.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				All the aforementioned pressures and more occur so that our faith can be tested. Those who will stand to the end are the elect who have made up their mind not to compromise and not to yield to all manners of pressures in whichever way they will come. That is why we must build up our most holy faith. Unfortunately many Christians are not preparing for tougher cases of persecution. Those who were ill-prepared in the past did not find it easy to succumb to compromise. Pray daily to strengthen your faith and consecrate yourself daily. Don’t be carried away by the ease and comfort around you for now. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
