            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Ps. 33:12</strong> <br>                         
Blessed is the nation whose 
God is the LORD; and the

				<p>We pause today to remember Nigeria’s independence. Every nation has a day which is set aside to remember its nationhood. Such a day may be the day which is the anniversary of the nation’s independence. For example July 4 is the day which United States celebrates its independence yearly. It is a federal holiday commemorating the adoption of the declaration of Independence on July
4, 1776, by the Continental Congress declaring that the thirteen American colonies regarded themselves as a new nation. In Nigeria it was on October 1 1960 when the nation got her independence from Great Britain, the same nation from which the United States had gotten her independence in 1776.

				The desire of God is that nations will submit themselves to Him so that the rules of His kingdom shall be the rules by which such nations are governed. Wherever God is feared things go well. But opposite is what occurs in Nigeria. What we have in Nigeria for instance is a nation that wriggles in underdevelopment despite abundance of natural and human endowment. Every nation that forsakes God is a nation under darkness. For many nations the darkness is palpable today. That is why such nations struggle with terrorism. The orgy of violence all around the world today is beyond what the United Nations can cope with. The root of these violent acts is not military weapons. At the root are the souls of men and women who have been misguided by religious tenets founded on falsehood and these millions of souls have sold their souls to the devil and they are irreversibly committed to the perpetration of atrocities. All wars, corruption, orgies of violence, ethnic cleansing, inhumanity of man to man are symbolic of darkness. <b>When a people dwell in darkness, they shout peace but what they practice is violence.</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				they practice is violence.
Sin is an evidence of darkness. Even nations that laid their foundations on the word of the living God have abandoned their very foundations and today they labour under satanically inspired legislation that legitimizes the very acts which God expressly forbid such as homosexuality and idolatry. <b>Unfortunately, the farther a nation draws away from God the thicker the darkness it pulls over itself.</b> Every government under darkness loses the power to do what is right. For example, the United States government is helpless today in dealing with their gun laws as they helplessly mourn the murder of their innocent citizens time after time due to the same reason–madness of gun carriers. Nigeria is yet to come out of the woods of infrastructural decay and underdevelopment because of this palpable darkness. No nation is free until Jesus Christ becomes her Lord and God. May Nigerians deliver Nigeria from the captivity of darkness by turning to the Light of God. Amen. Rejoice in the Lord.
