            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Matthew 28:18-20 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Ps. 68:11</strong> <br>                         
The Lord gave
the word: great
was the company of
those that published
it.</code></pre>

				<p>
				Our Lord Jesus Christ left us with the Great Commission which is, we must take the gospel to the ends of the earth and make all creation hear the good news to the end that they might be saved, before His second coming. Every believer is automatically commissioned as an Ambassador of the
kingdom on earth in order to fulfill the commission. The office of the Ambassador is the highest a person can occupy on behalf of his own country, in another nation. What an elevation we have as His Royal Ambassadors (2 Corinthians 5:20). Any person who is commissioned is also a Commissioner. You have the power to oversee certain activities on behalf of the One who has commissioned you. He supplies you the power to function and guarantees that your needs shall be met. That is why David said in Psalm 37:35 that he had not seen the righteous forsaken. Heaven will never forsake kingdom ambassadors on their mission field.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Those who sign up for the great commission are made great by the King of the kingdom. Our memory verse says the publishers form a great company. When you become an evangelist who proclaims the good news you are automatically a great person just like John who came to herald the first coming of our Lord Jesus. Luke 1:15 said of him that he would be great. In Luke 1:32, our Lord Jesus who came to announce the kingdom on earth was also referred to as being great.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				You might have been searching for greatness. Here is your opportunity to be great in God’s kingdom. Those who prosecute the kingdom agenda to see to the rescue of perishing souls and to ensure the salvation of sinners have signed up for greatness and their names shall be engraved in the hall of the great, in heaven. Seek to be great in heaven, not in this temporary world.
				
				<br /><br />
				We are saved for good works and the pursuit of salvation for perishing souls is the good work. No other work on the earth, however beneficial is as good as the work of seeking the lost so as to reconcile the lost to our Father in heaven. That is the purpose for which Christ came to save the sinners. Now that you are saved you too must labour for the salvation of other sinners by joining the Great Commission. Rejoice in the Lord.
