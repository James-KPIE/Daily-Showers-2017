But the hour cometh, and 
now is, when the true 
worshippers shall worship 
the Father in spirit and in 
truth: for the Father 
seeketh such to worship him.</code></pre>

				A few days ago we considered the subject of idolatry. Simply put idolatry is the worship of anything other than God. It is clear from the first and second commandments that God does not condone the worship of other gods besides Him. We are told expressly not to bow down before any other god.
				
				
				</p>
				
				<p>
				When we worship God, it is an acknowledgement of God’s existence and that is the first thing faith does–to recognize that God is. This is also the confidence of our relationship with God. If we understand who God is, we will have no problem in worshipping Him. God is the uncreated Creator. He is the Almighty who has power and control over everything, both living and non–living. Everything is subject to Him and He is subject to nothing. He kills and makes alive. He enthrones kings and gets kings deposed. In His wisdom, all things were created. He is greater than the greatest and mightier than the mightiest. The so–called kings and despotic rulers like Napoleon, Hilter and Idi–Amin once lived and were a terror for a season but were cut off by the limitations of human beings after some time unlike God the great King whose reign endures forever. In His power, God changes times and seasons but He changes not. He is the ageless Ancient of days and the Rock of ages. Whatever He says is done and no power can refuse Him. Who will not worship and stand in awe of His majestic presence?
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Truly the scripture says only a fool says there is no God. We cannot see God but we can see His existence and observe His work in nature. We have called on Him and received answers to our prayers. We have witnessed divine intervention in countless situations. At the name of Jesus, miracles happen every day. God is alive and those who seek Him will always find Him. God is committed to showing Himself faithful to all those who genuinely seek Him. The works of His hands shall praise Him. And we are the works of His hands. We are all created to bring worship to God. We are given life by His breath and we are sustained by His power. He gives provisions to all those who look unto Him by faith and their expectations are not cut short. Worship of God and the fear of God go together. Those who truly fear Him will worship Him. Are you among these people? Rejoice in the Lord.
