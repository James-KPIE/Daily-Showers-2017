            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Ezekiel 12:21-25 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Ez. 12:25</strong> <br>                         
For I am the LORD: I will 
speak, and the word that I 
shall speak shall come to 
pass; it shall be no more 
prolonged: for in your days, 
O rebellious house, will I 
say the word, and will 
perform it, saith the 
Lord GOD.</code></pre>

				<p>
				We shall consider the subject delay from today. It is an issue that affects many people irrespective of background, race or gender. Both the rich and the poor do experience delays and there are numerous causes of delay. We shall attempt by the power of Holy Spirit, to unveil such causes and find how we can reverse delays or terminate their causes. Since God changes times and seasons, it is within His power to work out a turnaround for anyone who has suffered delay in the course of his or her life’s journey.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Before we examine the causes of delay, it is important to say that each believer must seek to know God’s purpose and plans for his life. This enquiry may help us to find out His timing for the manifestation of those things that we trust to achieve according to His will. Spiritual sensitivity is a great asset to every believer and we cannot afford not to be sensitive to God in the pursuit of purpose. A man who is sure of his destination will not be upset by where he is, presently. For example, when Jesus Christ was here, it was not possible for anyone to hasten the coming of the Holy Spirit to baptize the disciples. Our Lord Jesus had released the Holy Spirit to them as an indwelling Spirit according to John 20:21-22. That is similar to our experience when we are born again.
				<br /><br />
				At our new birth, the Spirit of God enters into us to make us Christlike. Jesus Christ asked the disciples to wait in Jerusalem until the Pentecost. So, the Bible says in Acts 2:1 that the Holy Spirit descended when the day of Pentecost was fully come. There was nothing anyone could do to hasten it. We need to know God’s timing for the events in our lives so we will not judge God or accuse God of delay. With God, there is a time for everything under the sun; there is an appointed time for every purpose.
				</p>
				
				<p>
Let us conclude the exhortation today with the understanding that God will not cause any delay for us unless there is a reason for it. His desire is that we shall suffer no delay. We can, therefore, pray together today that if there is any of our brethren who is suffering any kind of delay other than that which is according to God’s will, that heaven should open over such people for the quickening of time for the performance of that which God has ordained in their lives. There shall be no more delay. Rejoice in the Lord.				
				</p>
