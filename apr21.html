And Pharaoh said

Can we find such a

					The power of “one speech” can be tremendous. Barack Obama was reported to have drawn the attention of the political class in the United States when he made a famous speech at the 2004 Democratic Convention in Boston. It is reported that just before that
speech, his wife, Michelle hugged him backstage and whispered into his ear: <blockquote>“don’t screw it up, buddy.”</blockquote> He didn’t. According to the report, he created a buzz, and the buzz hasn’t stopped. He would have left office at the time you are reading this exhortation but the effect of the speech which shot him into political limelight will not go with his exit.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Just like Obama’s speech, Joseph had just one chance to have a conversation with the king of Egypt and that was it. The Holy Spirit gave him an inspiration that provided the solution to a national crisis and the king simply handed over the rulership of his kingdom to him. I am not sure anyone remembered that his jail term had not expired. His status changed forever. A former slave, he became the solution for a national problem and, indeed, other nations benefitted because they went to Egypt to buy food during the famine which was severe around the world.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					We were in a fellowship with a friend who related the power of “one speech” and how it fetched him a promotion in his career a few years ago. His company went on retreat at a time the company was doing very poorly. Then, he was given an opportunity to make a presentation which he did. At the end of his presentation the Chairman wondered whether he was truly from that same company. The retreat took place at the weekend. On Monday morning, his boss was fired and he was made the Managing Director of the company. Oprah Winfrey once said that there is no discrimination against excellence. There is always room at the top of the ladder of life even though the bottom of the ladder is always crowded.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					It has been said that success is preparation meeting with opportunity. God prepared Joseph because he stayed holy unto the Lord. God has never stopped to lift up His own children who will live unto Him lives of obedience. Who knows, you may be the next person in line for a lifting because of one speech. Rejoice in the Lord.

												<li>Lord, let me not always speak because I have to say something, but because I have something to say</li>
												<li>Holy Spirit, guide my speech and my utterance always.</li>
