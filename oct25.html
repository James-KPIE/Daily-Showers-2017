            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: John 3:3-8 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: 1 John 5:4</strong> <br>                         
For whatsoever is born of 
God overcometh the world: 
and this is the victory that 
overcometh the world, even 
our faith.</code></pre>

				<p>
				Another cause of delay occurs when your thinking is contrary to your redemptive reality. Many Christians find it difficult to believe that what the Bible says that Jesus had accomplished for them on the cross is true. To be born again is just the first step in stepping into our great destiny in Christ. <b>Every believer must work out his or her salvation as we search the word to find out what we are called in
redemption, what we have been given in redemption, what we shall become through redemption and the victory that we have in redemption.</b> Those are some of the things we must sit down and absorb into our spiritual mentality and our spiritual sense must become superior to all our natural senses if we must see the reality of what we are and what we have in redemption. <b>Your mentality must align with your redemptive realities.</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Every born again man or woman has been conveyed into a new kingdom. It is God’s kingdom. It is also called the kingdom of light or the kingdom of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. That kingdom was spoken of by Isaiah in prophecy in Isaiah 9:6. We are a new creation by virtue of redemption. The holy, spiritual nature of God which became corrupted in man after the sin of Adam in the garden of Eden is regenerated into us when Jesus Christ comes in to live in us by the power of the Holy Spirit when we are saved. <b>That is why you instantly hate sin the moment you are born again.</b> This is the foremost redemptive reality. If you stay sanctified unto Christ by the renewal of your mind by the word (John 17; 17; Romans 12:1-2 and Ephesians 5:26), your mentality will no longer harbor unholy and evil thoughts. Since the direction of your life is determined by your thoughts, Christlikeness will dominate all areas of your life as the word of God takes hold of your life. Thoughts of fear will be replaced by faith and thoughts of anxiety and worry will be replaced by the thoughts of peace and divine assistance.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Positive thinking and possibility thinking are products of faith encounters through the word of God. Our covenant mentality empowers us to think heavenly thoughts of divine security, divine provisions, divine promotion. In the eyes of the spirit you can see supernatural abundance as a reality where physically lack is a natural reality. When your thinking aligns with your redemptive reality, you will trigger supernatural intervention in your direction. That is when your spiritual sense is no longer overwhelmed by your natural senses. Every believer is under a responsibility (for his own advantage) to think as a heavenly citizen that he is because he that is from above is above all. You can avoid delays if you are able to position yourself in the place God has made for you in redemption. You have become an eagle who should fly and you should no longer crawl. Rejoice in the Lord.
