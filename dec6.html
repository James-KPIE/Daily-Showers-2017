            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: 2 Chro. 20:20-25 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Ps. 57:7</strong> <br>                         
My heart is fixed, O
God, my heart is fixed: I
will sing and give
praise.</code></pre>

				<p>
				I will never cease to be amazed by the Lord’s strategy through which He gave victory to King Jehoshaphat and the nation of Judah over the multinational army that came to fight the nation. Jehoshaphat had
gone before the Lord to cry unto God and to report the invading army to God. He had indirectly worshipped God from verse 6 upward when he recounted who God is and the testimonies of God in defending Israel His people and in fighting to preserve their inheritance which He had given to them. Worship is the art of ‘eulogizing’ God, appreciating and celebrating who He is. David did that so well in his different encounters with God. Worship also involves our calling to mind God’s testimonies and bringing them before Him as act of worship. That was what Jehoshaphat did.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				David was a man to emulate when it comes to violent praise. His word in today’s memory verse is a demonstration of violent praise. It means a commitment to praise God when things are going well and when things are not. It was prophet Habakkuk that wrote in chapter 3:17-18 <blockquote>“Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and their shall be no heard in the stalls: yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation.”</blockquote> That is the resolve of a man with David’s kind of commitment in praising God. Addicted kingdom citizens are committed praise-givers. They always find a reason to say ‘thank you Jesus’ all day. When all else seem to have gone down in their own lives, then they turn to God to thank Him for life and to praise Him for His sustaining everlasting hands. They praise Him for the enabling grace that flows from Calvary.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Kingdom addicts are obsessed with the mentality of gratitude. As one of my mentors said, he is blinded by the goodness of the Lord so much that he never sees anything the Lord has done which is not good. That should be our posture. We should praise God in the morning, in the noon time and in the evening. Even when we are asleep and soul should offer Him praise. Praise is perhaps the best way to glorify God according to Psalm 50:23. God deserves all our praise all of the time. Let us praise Him whatever happens just like David and Habakkuk. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
