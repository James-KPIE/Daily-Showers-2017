            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Eph. 5:25-31 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Eph. 5:25</strong> <br>                         
Husbands, love
your wives, even
as Christ also
loved the church,
and gave himself
for it;</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				We are examining what the posture of the Christian should be in the kingdom and we have been considering different areas. Today we shall look into the issue of marriage. We can never talk too much about the matrimonial home. The family is the nucleus of the society and every societal disorder is a product of a breakdown in domestic discipline. When fathers abdicate their responsibilities at home and children grow up without
the fear of God like Hophni and Phinehas (the sons of Eli) corruption and violence will be the order of the day in the larger society. If we get the home right, the society will be better for it.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The first responsibility of the husband as the father in the home is love. Every husband is commanded to love his wife as Jesus loves the church and laid down His life for the church. When the husband loves his wife and makes necessary sacrifices for her comfort, it will lead to harmony in the home. It takes the combined spiritual effort of both the husband and the wife to run the home successfully and lay a solid foundation for the children in Christ. The love of the husband for his wife is not conditional upon the submission of the wife in the first place. Many men have found it difficult to understand this. However, we must always refer to Jesus Christ’s pattern of love to see how we should function. Jesus Christ loved us while we were sinners and He died for our sin (Romans 5:8). Even after we are saved, we have nothing in us in terms of personal righteousness that will make God to love us. That is why we talk of grace and its three pillars which are unconditional love, unearned blessings and unmerited favour.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Violent love looks beyond circumstances and the merit of the recipient for expression. This kind of love says ‘yes’ you do not deserve to be loved, but I love you all the same. Violent love sees the bigger picture. It sees God at the other end as the One to be pleased. So I cannot withhold love from my wife because God will be displeased and I do not want to offend God. Are you a husband who has withheld love from your wife because she has not lived up to your expectation? Think again. She is a beneficiary of your love because God lives in you as a believer and you cannot deny God. Let the love flow and you will see your own life take a new turn. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
