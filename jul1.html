            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Dan. 6:22</strong> <br>                         
My God hath sent his angel, 
and hath shut the lions' 
mouths, that they have not 
hurt me: forasmuch as 
before him innocency was 
found in me; and also before 
thee, O king, have I 
done no hurt.</code></pre>

				<p>
				God is often silent after He has sent His angels to carry out assignments in favour of His children. For example, in Daniel chapter 3, as you read the story of the fiery furnace which the king ordered to be heated seven times, you wonder what God was doing. Couldn’t God stop His children from being thrown into the fiery furnace? The Hebrew boys did not know exactly what God had done but they just held unto their faith in Him. They trusted in God’s ability, to deliver them. In verse
18, they told the king that even if God did not deliver them, they were ready to die rather than worship the golden image which the king had set up. Unknown to the Hebrew boys, God had sent His Angel, Jesus Christ the Prince of peace who turned the hot fiery furnace to an air–conditioned room.
<p>
God’s silence does not mean inaction most times because God always knows what He would do. In John 6, when Jesus Christ told the disciples to go buy food for the multitude to eat, the Bible says Jesus tested them for He Himself knew what He would do (verse 6). It is often reasonable to be quiet and watch God do His best in our circumstances rather then get agitated. I am sure many adult Christians must have seen God solve their problems in ways they could never fathom. He is the Omnipotent God who can solve a problem in uncountable ways.
</p>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The case of Daniel was just like that of his colleagues. The lions were hungry and waiting to devour anything in sight. It would appear that Daniel had an idea of what God would do or he became aware of what God did when he landed in the den. In verse 22, he told the king that God had sent His angels and shut the mouths of the lions.

				</p>
				
				<p>
				In Exodus 23:20, 23 and Exodus 32:2, God told the people of Israel through Moses that He had sent His Angel to go before them to keep them in the way, to drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites and to bring them into the place which He had prepared. Yet the Israelites behaved foolishly many times as they demonstrated unbelief as soon as challenges appeared on their way. They even murmured and asked Moses to go talk to his God. The Almighty God kept quiet at such times because He had already sent His angels to work. If we are sensitive to God, we will be at rest. Rejoice in the Lord.
