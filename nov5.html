            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Heb. 2:15</strong> <br>                         
And deliver them who
through fear of death
were all their lifetime
subject to bondage.</code></pre>

				<p>
				There is no fear in the mind of Jesus. When we possess His mind as part of the divine nature that we share with God through redemption, we too should fear no more. Guilt is a primary cause of fear. We know
from the exhortation of yesterday that there is no more guilt for the forgiven believer. The third supernatural exchange which Jesus carried out for us on the cross of Calvary is that He exchanged <b>faith</b> for our <b>fear.</b><br /><br />
We are saved by faith but that faith is not our faith. The faith by which we are saved was given to us by God to enable us to believe His word which convicted us of our sins. Paul the apostle had this understanding and He expressed it in Galatians 2:20 (KJV) where he wrote thus <blockquote>"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loves me, and gave Himself for me.”</blockquote>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Faith is the perfect antidote for fear. As we build our faith on the word of God and His testimonies, our fear is dispelled. Our confidence is increased by the indwelling word of God in us. That is why Colossians 3:16 encourages us to be regular consumers of the word of life. The more of God’s word we eat, the stronger we become spiritually. Elijah ate the word and the word was to him the joy and rejoicing of his heart (Jeremiah 15:16). Ezekiel filled his bowels with the word of God and it was in his mouth as honey for sweetness (Ezekiel 3:3). The word of God is a booster of faith.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Jesus went to the cross to cancel all our fears. He has made us righteous through the work which He did on the cross. The righteous is as bold as the lion according to proverbs 28:1. Believers should not fear because we are more than conquerors and greater is the One who is with us than the One who is in the world. Jesus cares for us and when we abide in Him, all our fears will be gone. We don’t need to entertain any fear of tomorrow because He is already in our tomorrow. We don’t need to fear the enemy because when God is with us no one can be against us. The Spirit in us is the Holy Spirit of God. We cannot have the Spirit of God in us and be filled with any kind of fear. All fears are gone because Jesus lives in us.
				<br /><br />
				Jesus Christ has exchanged our fear with faith and this reality should dictate our reactions to all the circumstances of our lives. Be at rest. Those who fear God fear no other personality or any other thing. Rejoice in the Lord.
