            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Gen. 12:1-4 </h3>
            <pre><code> M.V: Gen. 15:6 <br>                         
And he believed in
the LORD; and he
counted it to him for
righteousness.</code></pre>We shall begin to consider Abraham’s credentials today. To some of our readers these credentials may sound familiar, but to others the insights to be shared are worth the exploration. Welcome to the journey.<br><br>The first credential of Abraham is<b> faith</b>. Indeed, we can call it the uncommon<b> faith.</b> This won him uncommon reward. Have you wondered why the Bible lays emphasis on Abraham’s faith as the proof of righteousness in the sight of God? Abraham was coming from a totally idolatrous background. No one in his family had ever served God. They were all serving idols. When the Lord singled him out for the call, I imagine the faith he had to respond to God because he had no example to follow. It was a great faith by which he did not consider what could befall him in a lonely journey with God and without an example to follow. It was risky to be the first one to embark on such a mission, but thank God Abraham took the risk and it eventually worked for him. Brethren, to follow God in righteousness as a lonely person in an entire tribe or clan couldn’t have been easy.<br><br>Abraham was helped in the early dispensation of grace because the law had not yet be given. Grace enables us to do those things which the flesh cannot help do. That includes obedience to the word of God by faith. We shall consider Abraham’s obedience tomorrow. Abraham’s faith was an uncommon faith.<b> It was the true Biblical faith by which we believe God in order to see the manifestations of what He has promised rather than believing God because He has done a supernatural act or blessed us in some way.</b> Abraham believed God, that He was able to bring to pass what He had promised. That was the faith in God which was commended. Abraham reckoned God faithful in His commitment to do what He has promised and God reckoned Abraham righteous for believing in Him by the word He had spoken.<br><br>Every other credential of Abraham on the platform of the covenant followed his faith in God. It is by faith that Abraham remained connected to God. Rejoice in the Lord.<br><br><div
