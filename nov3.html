            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Isaiah 53:1-5 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Isaiah 53:5</strong> <br>                         
But he was wounded for
our transgressions, he
was bruised for our
iniquities: the
chastisement of our
peace was upon him; and
with his stripes we are
healed.</code></pre>

				Jesus Christ bears all our burdens in His mind. He is our burden bearer. He went to the cross to bear our burdens. The cross of Christ was a place of supernatural exchange. On the cross of Calvary Jesus Christ our Lord took our burdens to give us His blessings. We shall consider the seven-fold exchange which were all for our benefits from today. The knowledge of the blessedness of the profits of the cross will not only deepen our knowledge about God’s kingdom which Jesus came
to the earth to establish, it will also impart us with confidence to press into our heritage in Christ.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The first burden which Jesus Christ bore for us was the burden of sin. He went to the cross to offer His life as an offering for our sin. The punishment for sin is the wrath of God which no man can bear. We cannot survive one minute of God’s wrath. Jesus Christ accepted to die in our place and to bear the burden of our sins because the sinless had to die for the sinful. The one who would bear the burden must be the one who could feel the pain. Angels were not called upon for the assignment for that reason. So Jesus Christ took the form of man for the fulfillment of that purpose. The wrath of God which our sins merited was exhausted on Jesus Christ while He was on the cross. His Father turned away from Him momentarily as He bore our sin on the cross because His Father would not behold iniquity. He cried aloud at that crucial moment asking why the Father forsook Him. He was made sin for us to receive the punishment for all our sins past, present and future. He is the eternal offering for all generations. Whoever was saved in the past, those who are saved today and those who shall be saved in ten, twenty or fifty years from hence (if the Lord tarries) all have their salvation by the precious blood which Jesus Christ shed on the cross for the remission of all sins, according to Hebrew 9:22. Jesus Christ has made a once-for-all offering for the sins of mankind.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Our Saviour and burden bearer exchanged sin with righteousness so that those of us who put our faith in His perfect work on the cross would receive the gift of His righteousness and obtain a right standing with God. This is the reason why every sinner should rush to Calvary as it were and embrace Jesus the Saviour through repentance so that he can be washed by the precious blood that was shed by our Lord Jesus on the cross. Jesus is ready to bear your burden of sin. Roll it over to Him by accepting him as your Lord and Saviour today. Rejoice in the Lord.
