            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Genesis 11:31-32 </h3>
            <pre><code>M.V: Acts 7:4<b style="color:red"></b> <br>                         
Then came he out of
the land of the
Chaldaeans, and
dwelt in Charran:
and from thence,
when his father was
dead, he removed
him into this land,
wherein ye now
dwell.</code></pre>Obedience is Abraham’s second covenant credential. You see, each of the progenitors of faith had one or two unique relationship factors by which they warmed themselves into the heart of God. For Abraham, it was <b>uncommon faith.</b> For Moses, it was uncommon meekness; for David it was <b>uncommon praise,</b> for Solomon it was <b>uncommon love;</b> for Job, it was <b>uncommon kindness;</b> for Daniel it was <b>uncommon devotion</b> and for Paul, it was <b>uncommon commitment.</b> From Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob, they all excelled in worship, a regular time of spiritual encounter with God. David and Solomon his son were very creative in songs, psalms and proverbs.<br><br>Abraham’s obedience was unique because he took steps of faith in obedience to God’s instructions even when the end of the journey he was asked to embark upon was not yet clear or certain. In Genesis 12:4, we are told that when God told him to go to a place He would show him, Abraham took off. He did not wait for all the details. That is uncommon obedience. It was not so with Abraham from the beginning. From all biblical accounts put together, Abraham heard the call of God but he stayed with his father until the latter died. The journey to Canaan which ended at Haran was not meant for Abraham and his wife. That is why verse 31 says that “they went forth with them.” Abraham and his wife were not supposed to be a part of that journey. Apparently, their adventure took some years while Abraham and his wife Sarah were growing older in age. Whenever we turn to God, God turns to us (2 Chro. 15:2 and James 4:8). If you don’t make the move, God will be looking at you. Abraham turned to God after his father died and it was then that his covenant walk with God began.<br><br>God has great things in stock for us as blessings but disobedience or delayed obedience can rob people of their inheritance in God. Have you delayed obedience in any area of your life? You need to get up and begin to make moves in obedience. Rejoice in the Lord.<br><br><div
