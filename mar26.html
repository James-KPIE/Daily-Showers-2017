And I will bless them that bless 
thee, and curse him that curseth 
thee: and in thee shall all families 
of the earth be blessed.</code></pre>

				<p>
					We cannot imagine what the seven magnificent promises of God to Abraham had done to our world. An insight into the impact of the blessing of Abraham which was enfolded in these promises will make us to magnify the Ancient of days for choosing to do so much for our world through one man. Christians owe the Jewish world so much gratitude. We received the word of God through
them, the patriarchs–Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were Jews, the Old Testament prophets were Jews. The Jewish people have blessed the earth beyond measure according to John Hagee in his book <b>Life’s challenges our opportunities</b> (2009). We shall consider some breakthroughs which the Jews made over the years even as the 100th smallest country in the world. No one fulfils–destiny unless he accomplishes God’s purpose for his life on earth. That is a great lesson we can learn from the Jews.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The uncommon influence of the Jews–the seed of Abraham through whom the Lord has blessed all the families of the world include the following achievements:
					<ul>
						<li>Israel designed the airline industry’s most impenetrable flight security. Even U.S officials look to Israel for advice on how to handle airborne security threats.</li>
						<li>In medicine–Israeli scientists developed the first fully computerized, non–radiation, diagnostic equipment for breast cancer.</li>
						<li>In technology–Israel has the highest concentration of high–tech companies in the world (apart from the Silicon Valley).</li>
						<li>In response to serious water shortages, Israeli engineers and agriculturists developed a revolutionary drip irrigation system to minimize the amount of water used to grow crops.</li>
						<li>The cell phone was developed in Israel by Motorola, which has its largest development centre in Israel.</li>
						<li>The Pentium MMX Chip technology was designed in Israel at Intel</li>
						<li>Voice mail technology was developed in Israel.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Those are just a few of modern day breakthroughs from a nation that is only sixty–eight years old as at the time of writing this piece. There is more in all of those who are connected to Abraham through Jesus Christ than they can ever think. Rejoice in the Lord.
