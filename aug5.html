And the things that
thou hast heard of
me among many
witnesses, the same
commit thou to
faithful men, who
shall be able to teach
others also.</code></pre>

				<p>Every believer is a kingdom ambassador and as such must be committed to the expansion of the kingdom on earth. Our Lord Jesus came to establish the kingdom of God on earth. In Matthew 4:23, the Bible says: He went about preaching the gospel of the kingdom. Until a person is saved from sin and the captivity of the devil, by the blood of Jesus, He or she belongs to the kingdom of the devil or the kingdom of darkness. However,
according to Colossians 1:13, as soon as we are redeemed by the blood of Jesus, we are conveyed or transported from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God’s dear Son, Jesus Christ. Every person who has experienced this transformation enters into a new life and would desire that other sinners also have a taste of the new life. He or she would hate unrighteousness by loving what God loves and hating what God hates. Any Christian who is unconcerned about the salvation of his relations, his neighbours, his co-workers, co-students or his friends who have not received Christ is probably not genuinely saved or has backslidden or his faith is growing cold and needs revival.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Our Bible passage for today opens our eyes generally to our commitment to kingdom service and our posture as citizens of the kingdom. We are soldiers for Christ not because we are to carry guns and fight physical battles but we engage in spiritual battles to overcome all the schemes of the wicked to enslave our souls again or to make us lose our testimony. We wage the war to keep our mind on the right track of thoughts everyday and we are guided in doing that by Philippians 4:8. We fight to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints according to Jude 3. We fight the spiritual battle to ensure that the mercy, peace and love of God be multiplied unto us. We fight to save our relations and others from going to hell. We fight the battle to enforce our heritage in Christ and preserve our testimony.
				</p>
				
				<p>In the next few days, we shall consider our commitment to kingdom expansion. The terrorists who are causing havoc all over the world today would have been peace-loving people had they met Christ the Prince of Peace. This is the time to arise and do the work of the evangelist that each of us is called by God in Christ to be. Get ready. Rejoice in the Lord.
