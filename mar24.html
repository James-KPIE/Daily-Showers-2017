            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V Gal. 3:14</strong> <br>                         
That the blessing of Abraham might 
come on the Gentiles through Jesus 
Christ; that we might receive the 
promise of the Spirit through faith.</code></pre>


			<div>
				Jesus Christ is the Source and facilitator of the blessing. His name is Emmanuel and He was with everyone who accessed the blessing in the Bible. Emmanuel means God with us. When we were estranged or alienated from God through the sin of Adam, God initiated a plan B which brought Jesus Christ, the last Adam to undo the bondage which the sin of Adam had sentenced mankind to and as He shed His blood
on the cross at Calvary, the blessing which Adam lost was restored unto everyone who will put his or her faith in the efficacy of Christ’s accomplished work on the cross and be saved.<br /><br />
As I mentioned earlier on this subject, Abraham is our point of reference in the covenant lineage. The Jews could have direct link with the blessing of Abraham as his natural descendants but God did not want it to be kept away from the rest of us. Therefore, Jesus Christ came to connect the Gentile to the blessing of Abraham through redemption. In summary, Jesus Christ played a dual role in this covenant link to the blessing of Abraham–one, He died to restore the lost relationship between us and God; two, He now gave us access to the blessing of Abraham. It is a valid prayer if we ask God to bless us with the blessing of Abraham in the name of Jesus. That is one of the accomplishments of our Lord Jesus and a reward for His suffering and death on the cross and our own benefit in redemption.<br /><br />
Jesus is our connection to the blessing. That is why we must ensure that Emmanuel (God with us) becomes a reality in our lives. True to His name, He was with Noah (Genesis 6:9), and with Abraham (Genesis 21:22); with Isaac (Genesis 26:3); with Jacob (Genesis 28:15); with Joseph (Genesis 39:2-3); with Moses (Exodus 3:12) and He was with Joshua (Joshua 3:7). He was also with Samuel (1 Samuel 3:19); with Gideon (Judges 6:16); with David (1 Chronicles 11:9); with Solomon (2 Chronicles 1:1) and with Jeremiah (Jeremiah 1:8). In the New Testament, He was with Mary (Luke 1:28); with John (Luke 1:66); with Paul (Acts 18:10); and with the Apostles (Mark 16:20). Turn to Emmanuel, the Facilitator of the blessing and He will deliver it to you. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
