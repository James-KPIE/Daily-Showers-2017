				We dealt with one major obstacle to prosperity yesterday and that is the way we think. No one can help a man with the wrong mentality to overcome poverty, whereas, when a man thinks right and works and prays, no devil can stop him from doing well. There was the story of two young unbelievers who
went to a diviner to inquire about their future. The diviner told one that he would become a king and told the other one that he would end up as a slave. The first went away rejoicing without doing anything but merely waited until the day he would be crowned a king. The second went away sad but with a determination not to end up as a slave. So he went to the jungle and began to cultivate large farms. Years later, there was severe famine in town until hunters located the prosperous farmer and called the attention of the people in the town, who went to beg the man for food. The man asked for the condition upon which he would give them food and they asked him to become their king. The other man who was lazy and would not work hard ended up as a slave. If you will think right, you will act right and live right. Wrong mentality is a provoker of poverty.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The sin of envy will always hinder people from prospering. As long as Rachel envied Leah, she remained barren. A person who fights prosperity by speaking evil of the one who has prospered may also push himself or herself into poverty. Michal, the daughter of King Saul was barren for life because she despised King David in his most joyous and prosperous hour–when they brought the ark of God to Jerusalem. <b>Whatever you don’t like, you will always lack.</b> Many people despise the prosperous, speak evil of them instead of praising God with them and getting closer to them to learn their secrets, especially those who fear God and become prosperous.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The sin of selfishness is a curse that brings poverty also. If liberality brings enlargement, being stingy will leave a man lean and poor. If a man continues in his sin, God will not be interested in backing him up. He will lack peace with God, the power of God, the presence of God, the partnership with God, the provisions of God and the promotion of God. Pay special attention to our memory verse for today. Stop hindering your own prosperity. Rejoice in the Lord.
