            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Levi. 6:13</strong> <br>                         
The fire shall ever 
be burning upon the 
altar; it shall 
never go out.</code></pre>

				Every Christian who is not consistently filled with the Holy Spirit is at the risk of backsliding. Just as fish cannot survive without water, we cannot survive this world of sin without the Holy Spirit. Unfortunately, it is possible
to still carry on for a while as if the Holy Spirit has not left us and that is why
we must be aware of this truth and guide against spiritual stagnancy by seeking to be re-filled with the Holy Spirit so that we don’t lose the zeal and the fervency for the pursuit of the salvation of sinners.
<br /><br />
The Apostles have set the example for us. They were filled and re-filled time after time, else they would have become weary and given up on the great commission. These same apostles were beaten up and kept in the prison where they were equally maltreated. Their bodies were brutalized and wounded. Then they were released and the next thing they did was to assemble themselves in one of their houses to pray together until the Holy Spirit filled them again and there and then vowed to go back to the same task of evangelizing the word. Within twenty-four hours, they were back on the streets of the same city were they had just been released from jail doing the very thing they were previously jailed for. That kind of stubborn resistance to intimidation is only possible by the power of the Holy Spirit. Christians who are not regularly filled with the Holy Spirit will faint when the pressure to give up comes through persecution, oppression and intimidation.				</p>
				
				<p>
It requires the fire of the Holy Spirit to be unreservedly committed to evangelism. Our Lord Jesus Christ knew how weak we all are in the flesh. Peter demonstrated that on the night when he betrayed Jesus inspite of Jesus Christ’s clear and repeated warnings. His resolution not to deny his Master at that hour was not backed up by the Holy Spirit. The commitment lacked the power of the Holy Spirit, so, it fizzled out at the appearance of a little test.				</p>
				
				<p>
As we consider the great effects of the in-filling with the Holy Spirit, we must also remember that it is the word of God that provides the fuel for the fire of the Holy Spirit. Don’t ignore the word when you are desperate for the power of God. See Proverbs 26:20. When you are loaded with the word of God, it will be easy to remain constantly filled with the Holy Spirit who will energize the word in you. Rejoice in the Lord.				</p>
