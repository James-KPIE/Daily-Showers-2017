            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Gen. 1:11</strong> <br>                         
And God said, Let the
earth bring forth
grass, the herb
yielding seed, and the
fruit tree yielding
fruit after his kind,
whose seed is in
itself, upon the earth:
and it was so.</code></pre>

				<p>
					The power of ‘one seed’ is beyond human imagination. The future of every tree is in its seed. The big oak tree comes from the womb of an acorn. God organized multiplication of the human race through the power of the seed when He created Adam. Inside Adam was the seed which carried every person who has been born on the planet earth and even the unborn. We know this because
God never created another man the way he did Adam. He even
brought Eve out of Adam. In the redemption equation, Jesus became the seed of Abraham and those of us who are born again became the adopted children of God and in relation to the Abraham, we are children of the covenant (Acts 3:25 and Galatians 3:16).
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The power of the seed has been the force behind miraculous turnarounds over the centuries, in the Bible days and even today. I remember that in the last quarter of 2009, I was broke one Sunday morning I found one thousand naira to sow as a seed of faith, trusting the Lord for financial blessing. The following morning, I went out to see a client over a legal matter which I was handling for him. When we spoke on the issue of professional fees, I ask for two million naira but to my great surprise, my client said he would pay three million naira and went further to ask me if I wanted the whole sum in cash at once. It was like a drama. I asked that part be paid in cash and the rest in cheque and in less than one hour, I drove away with three million naira within twenty four hours of sowing a seed of just one thousand naira! The way of our God is past finding out! O, for grace, to trust Him more!
				</p>
				
				<p>
					We must understand and live by the power of the seed. For example, humility is the seed for honour (Proverbs 15:33); forgiveness is the seed for relationship; honour is the seed for access (the level of fortune your hand will ever touch is a function of the kind of people you choose to honour (Exo. 20:12; Hebrews 7:7). First fruit is the seed for overflowing blessing (Prov. 3:9-10); tithing is the seed for sorrow- free blessing (Malachi 3:9-10; Prov. 10:22). Thanksgiving is the seed for more and praise is the seed for fearful and overflowing harvest (Ps. 67:5-7). Rejoice in the Lord.
