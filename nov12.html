            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Phil. 2:5-10 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: John 14:14</strong> <br>                         
If ye shall ask any thing
in my name, I will do it.</code></pre>

				The name of Jesus is the name above all names. That is a big advantage for those of us who are connected to Jesus by redemption. We must understand that the name of Jesus is not a magic. It is not a
name to be chanted as herbalists would do with their voodoo powers. The name of Jesus is a supernatural name that carries effect on the sanctified tongue of the believer. The use of His name is one of our major privileges in redemption. The name of Jesus answers to us because we have received Jesus and consequently we enjoy the power of sonship according to John 1:12. When we call the name of Jesus we are exercising our right of citizenship in His kingdom. He is our King and we as citizens of His kingdom have the redemptive privilege to use His name at all times when we pray. We have been given the power of attorney for the use of His name.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The story of blind Bartimaeus opens our eyes to the power in knowing the name of Jesus. Grace moved the blind man on the day of his healing to ask passers-by what was going on, that there was the sound of a crowd where he stayed along the road to receive alms. He was only blind but not deaf. He was told that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by. He would have heard of the miracles Jesus had done which had made His fame to spread across the cities. May be he also told the helper who stayed with him to hint him when Jesus passed by. As soon as Jesus got to where he stood he started to shout “Son of David, have mercy on me”(Mark 10:46-52). Jesus heard him and stopped. The name he called our Lord Jesus was a name that was deep in nature. He arrested the attention of Jesus Christ who asked him to come. The people around him restrained him but the Lord Jesus insisted and the same people echoed to him that the Lord Jesus was calling him. He got his miracle by the mercy of the Lord. Grace made way for the man to get his healing as he called the name of our Lord.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We must ensure that we remain connected to Jesus at all times through daily consecration. As we remain sanctified unto Him the name of Jesus becomes effectual on our tongues. We can command the miraculous to happen and demobilize powers of darkness or call forth the things that be not as though they are through the name of Jesus. You can cause your total health to spring forth at the name of Jesus. Rejoice in the Lord.
