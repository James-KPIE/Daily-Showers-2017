Even so faith, if it

being alone.</code></pre>

				As children of God we must work because God is a worker. Whoever hates work does not have God’s nature. God worked since the beginning of creation and He still works. We are all a proof of God’s work. We are His vineyard (Isaiah 5:7). God is so
engaged in working that He neither sleeps nor slumbers. He does signs and wonders every day. He delivers and heals and He is at work round the clock. If we resemble our Father we will embrace work and work.<br /><br />
Work is the proof of faith according to Apostle James. Jesus Christ came and worked until He gave up His life on the cross that we could be saved. He called busy people to be His disciples, not those who were idle. People who are idle men and women who don’t want to exert physical and mental energy to earn a living are liabilities to their world. You don’t want to be one of them.<br /><br />
Work is a covenant responsibility. Children of the covenant keep working because the covenant can only become effectual in their lives and endeavours on the condition that they work. We are talking here about the blessing covenant. Abraham went to work after God had released the prophetic blessing of the covenant on him. He exerted physical energy even as an old man. He was not lazy. The blessing is a supernatural impartation that positions a covenant child for the supernatural advantage. When it rests upon you, then it will bring positive divine influence upon your life and affairs. Therefore you may flourish in famine as Isaac did, or enjoy uncommon lifting by divine positioning in a strange land as it happened to Joseph and Esther.<br /><br />
When the hand of the blessing of God rests upon your destiny, you can become a manifestation anywhere on the surface of the earth. Wherever divine influence extends, you can enjoy favour and flourish there. Remember: the blessing can only be experienced if you create room for it by working. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />

											<h3>Prayer Points </h3>
											<ol>
												<li>Thank You Father for putting the covenant blessing in place.</li>
												<li>I shall not lose the blessing through indolence, in Jesus name.</li>
