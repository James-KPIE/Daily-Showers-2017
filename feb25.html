            <h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>
            <h4 align="right">Sat. Feb.25, 2017</h4>
            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Genesis 28:11-22 </h3>
            <pre><code> M.V: Lev. 6:13 <br>                         
The fire shall ever
be burning upon
the altar; it shall
never go out.</code></pre>The altar encounter is the<b> fourth</b> credential of Abraham. It is a place of renewal of our spiritual lives and a place of repair for our destinies. When Jacob returned to the Lord one symbolic step which he took to establish the renewal of his covenant relationship<br>with God was that he built an altar unto God. In verse 22 he said: “And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God’s house; and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.” From that point, Jacob grew in his relationship with God as he became more and more spiritually inclined rather than seeking carnal solutions to his challenges. For example, after Laban had short-changed him several times, he turned to the Lord in Genesis 30:33 following the critical questions he asked himself in Genesis 30:30. The response from heaven was an idea which has never been given to any person since then, for the multiplication of livestock. That was how he finally got his major financial breakthrough.<br><br>The altar is the place to receive strategies for the way forward in your life.<br>The altar is a place where self is crucified and you position yourself for that level of spirituality whereby you can pick signals from heaven, regularly. Jacob went on to carry out some spiritual assignments which only a person at the altar could do. In Genesis 48 and 49, he spoke prophetically to the lives and future of the children of Joseph –Manasseh and Ephraim as well as to his twelve sons. It is so amazing that the personal prophesies which he released upon his twelve sons began to influence their generation, till today. Thank God for intervening in the cases of Reuben and Levi because of the role Reuben played in saving the life of Joseph, and Levi for choosing to be on the side of the Lord when Moses returned from the mountain and met the children of Israel in whoredom in Exodus 32. You can engineer your spiritual growth at the altar.<br><br>You can return to the altar afresh for God is waiting for you. Rejoice in the Lord.<br><br><div
