				In the pursuit of a liberal and generous spirit, Abraham was very kind to friends and to strangers. He took many servants into his sprawling estate, housed them and fed them daily. They grew up and got married while in Abraham’s service and they had children whom he also accepted as extended members of his business empire, to nurture and to take care of their welfare. What a man with a large heart! Only God knows
how much Abraham spent daily to feed hundreds or perhaps thousands of people in his employment. Only Solomon would have exceeded the number of people that Abraham fed daily in his house. Those who live for others never die. That is why Abraham is still our point of reference in many areas of our Christian walk today. Abraham stood out in generosity.<br /><br />
The word of God encourages us to be generous. When we are generous we open up our lives to the overflow of God’s love. In Psalm 23:5, David said that the Lord prepared a table before him and anointed his head with oil and caused his cup to overflow. The secret of David’s overflowing blessings was David’s spirit of love and generosity. He made room for people and empowered the “nobodies” to become noble men. He extended generosity to the descendant of his worst enemy who had wanted to terminate his life prematurely.<br /><br />
People of liberal spirit always enjoy divine enlargement. Abraham received Isaac for a specific time in Genesis 18:10 after he had fed the strangers who turned out as the company of the triune God. If he had shunned them he would have missed divine visitation. Meanwhile, those strangers did not seek succour in Abraham’s tent. He saw them, greeted them and gave them an invitation with persuasion. There are people who would not even oblige to offer help to strangers who seek help. They say it is too risky to help the person you did not know. We dealt with the issue of risks yesterday. If Abraham had not taken that glorious risk, Isaac might still have remained in prophecy only. But on that day Isaac was delivered for a specific time.<br /><br />
How far can you go in being generous? It is your gateway to enlargement. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
