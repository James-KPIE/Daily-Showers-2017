            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Ps. 27:4</strong> <br>                         
One thing have I
desired of the LORD,
that will I seek after;
that I may dwell in
the house of the
LORD all the days of
my life, to behold the
beauty of the LORD,
and to enquire in his
temple.</code></pre>

				<p>
					Men of singular pursuit are dangerous men to toy with. Such men capture the essence of God in one description and they allow their discovery to rule their lives. David discovered that God can be ‘available’ to a man in different manifestations at the same time through His manifest presence. Therefore he concluded that the one thing he would do was to seek the Lord’s presence continually. That is what he meant by dwelling
in the house of God all the days of his life. In Psalm 16, he said
that in the presence of the Lord is fullness of joy and at the right hand of God are pleasures for evermore. Therefore, if you gain an entrance into God’s presence, you have a guarantee of a change of story irrespective of what your challenge may be.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I have concluded that if you can ignite the presence of God, then you may ignore the plans of the devil. Powers that dare the life of a man who walks in the manifest presence of the Lord do so at their own peril. The Psalmist went further in Psalm 84:10(b) by saying: “…I would rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tent of wickedness.” If you will pursue the presence of God as Moses did (Exodus 33:15-16), you will be victorious all the way. David knew how to provoke God’s presence. He did it through praise. He used the key of praise to gain access into God’s presence continually. In Psalm 22:3, David caught the revelation that God would always make Himself available where praise is offered to Him. Why? Is it because God loves to dwell where He is glorified, and Psalm 50:23 says whosoever offers praise glorifies the Lord. Wherever God is present, His glory comes down and when God’s glory comes down, no enemy can abide there. God’s presence is all you need to win all your battles. God’s power is always available where His presence is.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Paul was also a man of one pursuit. He had a hunger for God. Therefore he set his face continually towards the glory that was set before him just like our Lord Jesus Christ and would not let the past stand in the way of his future (Philippians 3:14) because there is no future in the past. You too can make a discovery as David and Paul did and be a winner the rest of your life. Rejoice in the Lord.
