            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Psalm 102:1-14 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Ps. 102:13</strong> <br>                         
Thou shalt arise, and
have mercy upon
Zion: for the time to
favour her, yea, the
set time, is come.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>We closed the exhortation for yesterday with a brief reference to the psalm we shall consider today especially the portion that relates to favour. Favour does not just happen. Those who are favoured by God are often those that grace has pushed to respond to God in a manner that is
unique or to take a step that provokes the release of favour. The Bible is filled with examples. God favoured Noah because grace helped him to stand out in righteousness. Abraham was highly favoured because, he was the first person who caused God to eat the food of man. His unusual hospitality pushed him into the corridor of God’s favour. Isaac was favoured because grace enabled him to be sensitive to divine signals. Jacob was favoured because grace gave him a second chance and he grabbed it with all his energy. Joseph was favoured because grace empowered him not to lose focus in purity, thereby preserving God’s gift that made way for him. Esther was favoured because grace made way for her as she obediently listened to the counsel of Mordecai. David was favoured because grace gave him access to the Lord’s heart through praise. Solomon was favoured because grace moved him to offer unto God in gratitude the worship offering which no one had ever brought before God in Israel. The list is endless.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Favour follows those who do God’s pleasure. Most times brethren claim favour by simply standing on Psalm 102:13 in prayers. That is not enough. You need to go further to verse 14. In which area are you showing pleasure in making your own contribution to the kingdom of God? Favour may come as a product of divine sovereignty without our merit at all. However, favour may and is often released when you show interest in what touches God. For example, soul-winning is God’s heartbeat. I have asked brethren in some churches in the course of this year what service they are rendering to God for which God should keep them alive for a long time. The truth, my brethren, is that at the end of the day, nothing goes for nothing even in God’s kingdom. Do you want a harvest of favour? Then sow the seed of service.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Favour is getting God to show up for you in all that you do, that you may enjoy steady and rapid progress. When the life of Abraham became a seed in God’s hand, God became his harvest (Gen. 15:1). That is the favour equation. Know it for yourself. Rejoice in the Lord.
