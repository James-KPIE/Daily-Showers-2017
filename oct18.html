				You will easily overcome delay whenever you can draw God into your challenge by understanding. Many Christians suffer delay because they handle their challenges with knowledge only. Knowledge, Understanding and Wisdom are three different things.
Knowledge is information, understanding is comprehension and wisdom is application. If you have knowledge and no understanding, knowledge, only will not solve your problem. That is why it is not only about knowledge as important as it is, but much more than knowledge you need understanding. Many of us know how to drive our cars. As long as the engine is running well and other things are in good shape, we are good with the car. But we have problems whenever there is a breakdown due to an engine problem. It is because we know how to drive the car but we do not understand the workings of the engine. When we are stuck, a person who understands the working of the engine must come to our rescue. We are delayed until such a person comes.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				People with understanding handle issues of life better than those who merely boast of knowledge. A man of understanding is likely to have a multi–dimensional approach to solving problems or get himself out of trouble. I have seen this played out once and again especially in marital affairs and elsewhere. I have seen junior officers fight their bosses who have nothing to lose. I have seen foolish wives assert parity with their husbands. I have seen immature husbands maltreat their wives. A man with knowledge may know the rules, but the one with understanding knows the exception. You need more than knowledge to navigate the tempestuous waters of this life. Knowledge alone may make a man boastful but a man of understanding handles knowledge with caution. Those who have understanding know that there is always a better person and that helps them to keep their heads low.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<b>Wisdom is the correct application of knowledge.</b> To be wise is to know how to find solutions to problems by applying knowledge appropriately. But it is not every knowledgeable person that is wise. A perfect example is a medical doctor who smokes. Doctors warn us that tobacco smoking is inimical to health and that smokers risk early death. So the wise person who is armed with that knowledge runs away from smoking. Yet a medical doctor smokes in chain. A person who runs his affairs with understanding will never be stranded. Do you have issues of life which you have laboured to handle? Seek understanding. Apply wisdom. Receive solutions without delay. Rejoice in the Lord.
