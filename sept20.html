And God opened her eyes, and 
she saw a well of water; and 
she went, and filled the 
bottle with water, and gave 
the lad drink.</code></pre>

				<p>God can send help to us from unlikely places just as He uses unlikely things to accomplish His purposes. As we observed yesterday, that is what makes God to be God –the unlimited power and possibilities in Him. You too must have started to feel a sense of being unlimited in what you can accomplish in God. The gladdening truth is that any person who can truly believe in God will experience boundless
possibilities in Him. Indeed, the essence of faith is to make everything which God can accomplish a possibility for us. Have you wondered about how Luke 1:37 or Matthew 19:26 connects with Mark 9:23. The books of Luke and Matthew tell us that there is no impossibility with God. Then Mark tells us that if only we can believe, all things are possible to us. We are not equal with God but whatever God can do; our faith in Him makes it a possibility for us. That is the power of faith. And that is why we must be born again so we can harness the power of sonship. The gateway to an adventure of faith is our redemption. We are redeemed to have the faith of God (Galatians 2:20 KJV).

				When Hagar was sent away by Abraham at the insistence of Sarah, it was like the end of the road for Ishmael. How far can a bottle of water go in a journey through the wilderness to nowhere? Prophecy would have to speak in the life of Ishmael and that would deliver survival to him. God had told Abraham that Ishmael would be a nation, but Abraham did not tell Hagar. So, when the boy became famished, she lost all hope as she thought that the boy would die. She put the boy under a tree and she went a little apart so he would not die in her hands. Then the Lord sent a help in an unlikely place and in an unlikely manner. The woman suddenly saw a well of water. God had done it again. In the place of a bottle of water, a well of water was provided by Jehovah Jireh in the fashion in which he caused the appearance of a ram on mount Moriah. You can imagine the joy of a woman who was counting the last minutes of her son. God literally brought Ishmael back from death.

				<p>	
God still works wonders in the midst of men. He has the whole world as His jurisdiction, to do as He likes in the affairs of men. Please, don’t place a limit on what God can do in your life and how He may do it. He is the Almighty God who is able to spring surprises at any time. Wait daily by faith to see the new thing God wants to do for you and through you. Trust in Him. Rejoice in the Lord.
