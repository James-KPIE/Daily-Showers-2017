							<h1>OBEDIENCE COMMANDS ABUNDANCE</h1>

									<h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>							<h4 align="right">Tue. Feb. 7, 2017</h4>
									
									<h3 style=color:red>Daily Reading: Job 36:11 </h3>
									<pre><code> <b style=color:red>M.V: I Sam. 15:22(b)</b> <br />                         
Behold, to obey is 
better than sacrifice, 
and to hearken 
than the fat of rams.</code></pre> 

									<p>
The reward of abundance is the portion of those who will obey the commands of the Lord. To live in prosperity means in part that one lives a lack-free life. It also means a peaceful life. A life of
prosperity and pleasure implies a healthy and a sorrow-free life. It is not necessarily a challenge-free life because without life’s challenges, there will be no opportunity to experience the victory which we already have in Jesus.
									</p>
									<p>
Everyone who will diligently obey God is qualified for a stress-free life, because obedience energizes trust and absolute trust in God is the key to a life of triumph. Only those who obey God as Job did will have their trust in God unshaken in the times of trial. Even when there is no tough trial, the disobedient lacks absolute confidence in God and this confidence is the bedrock of both faith and trust. For example, when a person who lives in disobedience prays, he does not have the confidence that he will receive an answer to his prayers because disobedience cannot produce the boldness which is required for access to God’s holy presence on the mountain of intervention. When your obedience is complete, you will have no problem trusting God in all the circumstances you may find yourself.									</p>
									<p>
As we continue to consider the kingdom covenant reward system, we need to find out what kind of obedience will elicit a response from heaven that commands the abundance as the reward. From the story of King Saul in1 Samuel 15, it is complete obedience. Anything less than complete obedience will not please our holy God. King Saul was commanded by God to wipe out the Amalekites. He went in a war campaign to do so but he left untouched some of the fat rams which he claimed he wanted to sacrifice to the Lord. As harmless as his act of disobedience would appear, God did not take it kindly. It was one of the errors that cost him the throne. When you pay only a part of your tithe you are in the same shoes with King Saul. Watch it. Our obedience must be total. Rejoice in the Lord.									</p>
