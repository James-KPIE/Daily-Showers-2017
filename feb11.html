            <h4 align="right">Sat. Feb. 11, 2017</h4>
            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: 2 Cor. 8:1-9 </h3>
            <pre><code> M.V: John 3:27<b style="color:red"></b> <br>                         
John answered and
said, A man can
receive nothing,
except it be given him
from heaven.</code></pre>Paul the apostle singled out the churches in Macedonia for embracing the giving grace and practicing liberality inspite of their own felt-needs. Giving is difficult for many brethren and this is due to many factors. A Christian who has not caught the revelation in<br>our memory verse for today will continue to limit himself to what his natural power can fetch him as far as prosperity is concerned. Therefore, he will not be willing to take a risk to let go of what is in his hands. I have heard brother exclaimed “this is all I have on earth and in heaven (referring to the money in his pocket). How untrue that is for a believer whose Father in heaven is the possessor of heaven and the earth. How does he come to such a conclusion in view of scriptures like Psalm 24:1; Psalm 50:10, 1 Samuel 2:7-8; Genesis 14:22, Proverbs 21:20, Psalm 35:27 and 37:25. What redemption does is to connect us to the ‘all’ of God but it is unto each person according to his faith. You see, our prosperity is established in Jesus but it can only be guaranteed upon the conditions we have been discussing for the last few days.<br><br>Another factor is that every Christian needs deliverance from the spirit that make people stingy. Indeed we can outgrow it. I have also mentioned the issue of wondering who will give to you when you give in obedience to the word of God. It is not your business to bother about that, it is God’s assignment to figure it out. Some people also become discouraged to give because of the way churches or individuals have treated them, taking undue advantage of them. We must look beyond individuals and even the church sometimes and look unto Jesus Christ the author, perfecter and rewarder of our faith. .<br><br>When a Christian gets to the point where there is nothing he cannot surrender to God if God asks for it or when there is a need for it, he has arrived at the corridor of breakthrough in giving. That was the basis for my story on February 3. The beauty of the equation is that when you get to that level with God, He will surpass your expectations and giving will permanently become easy for you to do because the grace for giving propels you to give for as long as it is possible for you to do so. Rejoice in the Lord.<br><br><div
