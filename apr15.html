            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Rom. 5:21</strong> <br>                         
That as sin hath reigned 
unto death, even so might 
grace reign through 
righteousness unto eternal 
life by Jesus Christ 
our Lord.</code></pre>

				<p>
					Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, the same today and the same forever. As we read yesterday, He came to save the sinner from his sin. He bled and died on the cross in order to restore peace between the holy God and the sinful man. Adam had sinned against God in the Garden of Eden when he disobeyed the clear
instruction of God by eating the forbidden fruit. As at that time,
every human being that ever came and would ever come into this world was inside Adam in the form of a seed. Therefore, when the seed in him became corrupted, all of us became tainted with sin. That is why the Bible tells us in Romans chapter 5 that sin came into the world through one man. It also goes on to say that righteousness came through one man and that is our Lord Jesus Christ. The term ‘born again’ becomes understandable from the explanation that all those who were born into sin through Adam could experience a new birth unto righteousness through Jesus Christ and that is what salvation is all about. When we are saved by Jesus Christ, He becomes our righteousness.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Jesus Christ has been saving sinners by the power of the blood which He shed on ‘Good Friday’ which we remembered yesterday. In a thousand years from now if the Lord would tarry in His return, the same blood will continue to save every sinner who humbly comes to Christ and confesses his sin and asks for forgiveness. Jesus Christ is never tired of saving sinners. Therefore, He has offered salvation to all without any discrimination. That is why we must continue to debunk the lie of the devil that makes billions of people believe that Jesus Christ is the leader of Christians. No. He is not a religious leader but the Saviour of the whole world.
				</p>
				
				<p>
Let every person who belongs to any other religion know for a truth that Jesus Christ is waiting for them to ask Him to save them, and He will. Everybody who is not yet born again is the same in the eyes of the Saviour even if such a person was born inside a church or born in the temple or shrine of any idol. John 1:12 is clear on that as the scripture says it is those who believe in Him that can become His children. It is not about religion but it is all about relationship. Jesus Christ shed His blood so that every sinner who repents can become a child of God. You can do so today if you have not done so yet. Rejoice in the Lord.
