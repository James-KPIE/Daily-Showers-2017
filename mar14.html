For I know him, that he will 
command his children and his 
household after him, and they 
shall keep the way of the LORD, 
to do justice and judgment; that 
the LORD may bring upon Abraham 
that which he hath spoken of him.</code></pre>

				One of the few men that God trusted in the Bible was Abraham. And that was the nineteenth covenant credential of Abraham. God knows the heart of all men. He checks the motive behind every action that we take. In 1 Samuel 16:7, the Bible says God looks into the heart of men while men look at man’s face. Therefore God knows who to trust and who He should not trust. And if God cannot trust you, there is a limit to what He can commit unto your hands to do for His kingdom while we are here on earth.<br /><br />
Trust affects every area of our lives. It affects our relationships, our business, our prayers and much more. It affects our much desired prosperity. If God cannot trust you to handle one hundred thousand, why should He answer your prayers for one million. If God searches your heart and finds out that if you become richer you will marry a second wife and forsake the kingdom of God, He may not allow the release of a bigger financial blessing unto you. If God finds out from your heart that you have conquered greed and that nothing is uppermost in your heart than to do His will on earth, He may cause a rain of blessings on you so as to make you His earthly treasurer.<br /><br />
We need to ask ourselves serious questions on the issue of trust. Trust is the guarantee for triumph in every challenge that we face in life. If God can trust you and if you can also trust in Him, you will live a stress–free and concern–free life. Abraham earned God’s trust and He became his all. God literally gave His totality to the man He could trust. God said He could trust Abraham to bring up his children in the way of the Lord and that earned him some credit from God. Many parents leave their children to the vices of this sinful world and would not train them in the fear of the Lord. It is a sin that could take someone to hell. Parents who abandon this onerous responsibility will face God’s judgment on the last day. Take heed now. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
