            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Mark 5:20</strong> <br>                         
And he departed, and
began to publish in
Decapolis how great
things Jesus had
done for him: and all
men did marvel.</code></pre>

				<p>I pointed out two days ago that engagement in the glorious ministry of reconciliation which we call evangelism and soul-winning, is a proof that we are saved. The passion to witness to sinners about the saving grace of our Lord Jesus is always a burning passion in every genuine believer. We are not called to save the sinners, that is the work of the Holy Spirit. Our
assignment is to share our salvation experience with the unsaved person and help him to see his helplessness in overcoming sin and the need to trust his life unto Jesus Christ who bled and died for his sin. We are also to tell such a sinner that salvation is instant once he or she believes, confesses and forsakes his sin. Jesus Christ looks into the heart of man to find genuine repentance. Once those elements are in place Jesus saves the person automatically. It is a simple process with profound effects on a person’s spiritual life.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The kingdom of God has continued to expand on the earth since the time our Lord Jesus began His ministry. It was Andrew who first met Jesus and he went to tell Simon (verse 41). When Philip met Jesus he also went to tell Nathaniel (verse 45). The kingdom has multiplied over the centuries by this simple, Holy Spirit-inspired method. Today, we can easily invite people to the living church where we worship and he or she would meet Jesus there. Each of us who is saved must continue to replicate the practice which we find in the Bible. For example, in John 4:28-29, the Samaritan woman told the people of the city about her transforming encounter with Jesus Christ. Even the mad man of Gadara became an evangelist as a result of the deliverance and salvation of his soul. However, we must not push grace aside wherever we find opportunity to minister healing to the unsaved. A person may be healed by Jesus, first, before he receives Jesus as Lord and Saviour. We don’t need to make salvation a pre-condition for anyone’s healing. We should allow the flow of grace both for salvation and healing. However, there is nothing wrong if we start by leading such a sick person to accept Jesus Christ as his Saviour first.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				To seek the salvation of the unsaved is one pursuit that make us God’s darling. We shall consider the profits soon. Let everyone who has tasted the joy of salvation arise and begin to go in the power of the Holy Spirit everywhere, telling all that Jesus saves and transforms lives and gives hope to the hopeless. Rejoice in the Lord.
