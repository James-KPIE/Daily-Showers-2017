				<p>Easter Sunday reminds us of the victorious morning when the Lord Jesus rose from death and never tasted death again. We can recollect many instances when the Lord Jesus Christ raised dead people back to life. Some of them were young, like the son of the widow of Nain and the young servant of the Centurion. He also raised older people like Lazarus. All the people Jesus raised from death died again as natural human beings. Even
today, all the people who were raised up from the dead by various ministers and ministries have either died or will die ultimately because they don’t have the power of immortality. Our Lord Jesus died on the cross and rose again and He lives forever. Blessed be God Almighty forever and ever. Amen.
					
				</p>
				<p>
					When we celebrate Easter, we are celebrating the immortality of Jesus Christ and His triumph over death. It is also a reminder to all of us who are in Christ that there is life after life for us. In other words, when we depart this earthly life, we have the hope of eternal life which God has given to us through redemption. In John 14:1-3, Jesus Christ told us that He was going to heaven to prepare a place for us so that where He is, there we shall be with Him also. For the child of God who has been redeemed by the blood of Jesus, death is only a passage unto eternal life-everlasting life with the Father. Those who are saved in Christ never really die but pass unto the next phase of the fellowship which we have enjoyed with God here on the earth. What a great hope we have in Christ.
	
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The victory of Jesus over death proves to us that death is nothing for us to fear. It was in existence before Adam was created but it was inactive until sin came into the world. Sin is a provoker of death-spiritual death and in some cases, physical death. The devil uses death as a weapon to attack the destiny of people but we have the power of the Blood and the weapon of the Word to overcome such death (Revelation 12:11). It is important, therefore, to remind ourselves to be repositioned in Christ so as to overcome the torment of the devil which occurs because of sin, for God will not deliver the lives of His doves to the jackals. We have overcome death through the life we receive in Christ. Therefore, we fear death no more. Rejoice in the Lord.
