					Today is celebrated in the Christian world as Good Friday. As I wrote on this occasion last year, the event that made this day memorable was anything but good. It was a day when an innocent
man was brutally dealt with for an offence He did not commit. It was a day when the King of glory was made to wear a crown of thorns and was paraded as a common criminal. On that day the Prince of Peace was made to go through excruciating pains and the gushing of blood from His head and His side. However, the day became good for the eternal consequence of His suffering, death, burial and resurrection. The day became a good day for the prospective saint who would receive the atonement for his sins by the death of our Lord Jesus Christ on the cross and particularly by the blood which He shed for the remission of sin.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					This day is not only for the remembrance of the death of our Lord Jesus Christ, but much more, it is a day to let the whole word know that Jesus came to die for the sins of the whole world. He did not come to die for the sins of Christians. Indeed, it is only when a sinner believes in the efficacy of the word of Jesus Christ on the Cavalry tree and repents of his sin and receives forgiveness and cleansing by the blood of Jesus that he becomes a Christian and a born again child of God . We must also emphasis that Jesus did not come as a religious leader but as the Saviour of the world. He announced that He came from the Father in heaven. All the religious leaders that the world has ever known have no comparism with Jesus. Our Saviour did not bring any religion. He only came to announce the kingdom of God and its righteousness. All the religious leaders were created by the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the Creator of all but He Himself was not created. He was not born as any other human person was born.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Today will only be a Good Friday to those who will humble themselves before the Lord and repent of their sins so that the blood that flowed from the veins of Emmanuel can save their souls. And for those of us who are saved already, it is another opportunity to turn to the cross to be re-assured of our salvation as we sanctify our lives by the power of the living word. Rejoice in the Lord.
