            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Acts 1:8</strong> <br>                         
But ye shall receive
power, after that the
Holy Ghost is come
upon you: and ye
shall be witnesses
unto me both in
Jerusalem, and in all
Judaea, and in
Samaria, and unto
the uttermost part of
the earth.</code></pre>

				The kingdom of God is a kingdom of power. It is a spiritual kingdom with a King and our King the Lord Jesus Christ. The redeemed souls are the citizens of the kingdom and the kingdom is governed by a constitution which is called the Bible. This kingdom is constantly at war because the adversary presses to lock people out of it and if possible, to get the souls which have been conveyed into the kingdom back into the kingdom of darkness. That is where we need power to overcome the adversary and remain victorious
over sin, power to rescue those who are currently trapped in that kingdom of
darkness. Glory be to Jesus who has given us the power to accomplish all of these and much more.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Our Lord accomplished all the great works He did while He was here on the earth in the bodily form by the power of the Holy Spirit. Indeed, His conception was by the Holy Spirit and He did all the exploits by the power of the Holy Ghost. He offered his life to die by the eternal Spirit and He rose again from death by the power of the Holy Spirit. In order to effectively commission us to carry on the work of soul-winning and doing exploits, He gave power to us through the same Holy Spirit. As many as are born again and are sanctified or set aside for the Master’s use, the Holy Spirit will baptize so that through the baptism they will receive kingdom power. In fact, to operate in this power is proof that we belong to the kingdom. In 1 Corinthians 4:20, the Bible says the kingdom is not in word but in power. The ordinary word in our mouth, however philosophically sound, cannot achieve anything in the kingdom. When our word is Bible-based and Holy Spirit-empowered, we can win spiritual battles over the souls which the enemy has kept in captivity and perpetrate the harvest of souls for the kingdom.
				</p>
				
				<p>We all need the Holy Spirit baptism. Until we are filled with the Holy Spirit, we may not place much value on eternal matters. We remain as ordinary, carnal Christians who are moved by the ordinary things of this world rather than matters that pertain to the Spirit, if we are not baptized in the Holy Spirit. The secret behind the deep concern for souls by the disciples, for which they were ready to lay down their very lives, was because Jesus Christ breathed the Holy Spirit on them in John 20:21-22 thereby releasing the power for kingdom exploits to them. You need the power of the Holy Spirit to feel for sinners and pray for their salvation. Rejoice in the Lord.
