          <h1>ABRAHAM’S REWARD</h1>
          <!-- Text -->
          <section>
            <h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>
            <h4 align="right">Tue. Feb. 21, 2017</h4>
            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Genesis 15:1-15 </h3>
            <pre><code>M.V: Gen. 15:1<b style="color:red"></b> <br>                         
After these things <br>the word of the LORD
came unto Abram in
a vision, saying, Fear
not, Abram: I am thy
shield, and thy
exceeding great
reward.</code></pre><b>We work for reward; we don’t only pray for it.</b> If we pray for reward without working then we want to prove God a liar because His word says we shall receive the reward of our deeds according to Isaiah 3:10. Apostle Paul even went further to say that he that will not work should not eat. Our attention shall be focused on the work which Abraham did to justify the uncommon reward of God making Himself the very reward of Abraham. My understanding of what God told Abraham in Genesis 15:1 is that<b> when your life becomes a seed in the hands of God, He becomes your harvest</b>. In other words when your life is fully surrendered unto God, He becomes your all by making Himself available in all areas of your life. When that happens, wherever you turn to, you will find Him.<br><br>We can consider the example of Apostle Paul. For a long time, he was a Jew who was recruited to persecute Christians. When he became converted, he went full blast into the work of the kingdom, risking his life in the process. God was always there for him. In Act 16, he was jailed alongside Silas. The Lord caused an earthquake to shake the prison where they were kept, until their chains broke and fell off. God worked his freedom from the prison. In Acts 18, his life was at risk in Corinth as he preached the gospel but God appeared to him in verse 9-10 to give him the assurance of divine security and safety. Again in Acts 27, Paul was in a ship which was caught up in a disastrous tempest. There were other 278 people on that voyage. God moved in to announce to Paul that they would experience no loss of anyone’s life. The other voyagers did not die because Paul’s presence on the ship gave them a covering.<br><br>There is nothing greater than being possessed wholly by the Spirit of the living God. When that happens and God becomes your all, you will experience heaven on earth. Rejoice in the Lord.<br><br><div
