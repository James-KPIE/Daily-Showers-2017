            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Psalm 2 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Psalm 68:1</strong> <br>                         
Let God arise, let his
enemies be scattered:
let them also that
hate him flee before
him.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
In Psalm 102:13, the Bible tells us of two things that happen when the Lord decides to show favour to His people. These shall form our subjects today and tomorrow. From that verse we see that the Lord will arise. Secondly, He will show mercy. We shall consider the first aspect today which is that the Almighty God shall arise.				</p>
				
				<p>
The Lord of hosts does not just arise. When He arises it means there is an urgent business of the kingdom to attend to. It means there is a need for immediate intervention in the affairs of His people, in particular. For example, when the Israelites cried and groaned because of their slavery and oppression in Egypt, the Lord arose to answer to their cry and to deliver them. He raised Moses His servant and made him the eagle of the Old Testament to lead His people out of Egypt. He arose in order to show favour to His people. On the Passover night in Egypt, God granted the Israelites exceptional favour with the Egyptians and they spoilt the Egyptians and went away with so many goods.				</p>
				
				<p>
When Jacob cried to the Lord in Genesis 30:30 because of stagnation, lack and poverty due to the oppression he suffered in the hands of Laban, the Lord arose and gave Jacob an inspiration by which he put a strategy in place that multiplied the kind of cattle which Laban agreed should belong to Jacob as reward for his labour. Within a short time, Jacob’s cattle were worth much more than those of Laban. Wealth changed hands and the employee became richer than his employer. That is the work of favour.				</p>

<p>
The prayer of the psalmist in Psalm 2 was actually a prophecy concerning our Messiah and what would happen when He came. Those things started happening since the time when our lord Jesus was physically present on the earth. The heathen’s rage has been with us but the Lord has not and will never surrender Christianity to the rage of our antagonists who are the agents of the anti-Christ. The senseless killing of hundreds of thousands of peace-loving Christians around the world is part of the rage of the adversary. However, the Lord will keep laughing at them and He will uphold His church until the second coming of His Son. Let us hold unto the faith which Paul expressed in 2 Timothy 1:12. Until then, the Lord will always arise to show us favour and uphold His church. Rejoice in the Lord.
