            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Psalm 114 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Deut. 2:25</strong> <br>                         
This day will I begin to 
put the dread of thee 
and the fear of thee 
upon the nations that 
are under the whole 
heaven, who shall hear 
report of thee, and 
shall tremble, and be 
in anguish because of thee.</code></pre>

				<p>
				No one wants to stay around the place where his or her adversary is being praised, appreciated or eulogized. The same is true of the devil. Wherever true worship is agog, the enemy cannot stay to do his havoc. It appears many Christians have not learnt this truth. You can repel the adversary from your home or your business through the power of worship. The topic for the passage for our devotion today (Psalm 114) is ‘Tremble at the Lord’s Presence.’ We have made the point that praise and worship bring down the
presence of God, and there is no adversary that can stand the Lord’s presence. The majestic awesomeness of the Lord’s presence causes the enemy to retreat or vanish altogether.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				A life of daily worship at the altar is a vital tool by which you can keep the enemy at bay wherever you dwell. Worship can cause your environment to be spiritually sanitized thereby warding off all demonic activities. Spiritual music that glorifies God can keep God’s presence alive in your abode all the time. The devil cannot dwell where God is reigning and ruling. That is the reason why our homes must be kept rancor-free as much as possible so God can help us. Indeed, as a matter of deliberate practice, you need to ensure that at all times, sounds of praise and thanksgiving fill the air in your home. It will serve to keep blessings flowing in and it will not open the door to the wicked forces.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Let me close today’s exhortation with the issue of the kind of music that you play in your home. The nature of such music has a lot to do with the kind of spirit you invite into your arena. God-glorifying music will help to create an atmosphere for divine presence. Your family will readily have access to the power of God because wherever God’s presence is, His power will be there. Careless Christians who don’t take time to bring into their homes such music that glorify God may miss out on the Lord’s presence and may have to labour much longer at the altar of prayer than the home where the presence of the Lord is provoked constantly through holy music.
				<br /><br />
				Worship is a strategy by which we can repel the enemy and where our environment is saturated with songs that worship God, we are most blessed in His presence. Rejoice in the Lord.
