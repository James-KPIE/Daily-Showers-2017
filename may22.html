            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Matt. 2:2</strong> <br>                         

Saying, Where is he that 
is born King of the Jews? 
for we have seen his 
star in the east, and 
are come to worship him.</code></pre>

				We have identified that worship is what we are created to do. Worship means our total devotion to God; this is clear from Romans 12:1-2 where Paul wrote “Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God–this is your spiritual act of worship.” Worship does not begin with our singing of songs or
hymns. Worship does not commence from our mouth. Rather, worship proceeds from our heart. A life where God rules the heart is a life of worship. Indeed, if we express worship in our songs and in words that eulogize God while our heart are far from God, the act of worship is done in vain. Acceptable worship begins as a dedication of a Christian’s life unto God. That ensures that the Christian is no longer tied to idols for God cannot complete with any idol for our worship. That is why He says that He is a jealous God. Our God will not share His glory with any graven image.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				In the Bible passage for today’s exhortation, we see the Magi from the East who came to Jerusalem to worship Jesus Christ who was born in the manger. The Magi were called the wise men, which means, he who truly worships God in the spirit is wise. On the other side was the devilish Herod who also expressed his intention (deceitfully) to worship Baby Jesus. Today, we find liars who pretend to worship Jesus but with terrible motives. Many people are in the church to trade while others come to meet their economic needs or to find a wife. I remember a young man who joined a church and pretended that he was a serious follower of Christ until he went through all the procedure which the church laid down for intending couples. His wedding was solemnized accordingly. On the first night of their marriage, his wife requested that they should pray together before they went to bed but he declined. It was then he declared to the wife that his sole aim of joining the church was to get her for a wife and that henceforth, he would have nothing to do with the church.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Herod’s plot was foiled because the Magi were warned in the night not to return to him. May the Lord deliver His church from strangers who pretend to be true worshipers. Rejoice in the Lord.
