            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Matt. 10:36</strong> <br>                         
And a man's foes shall 
be they of his own 
household.</code></pre>

				The enemies within our hearts can cause delays in the achievement of our lofty goals and dreams. We have considered the role of sin in causing such a delay. And there are other fleshly and sinful attitudes which will equally cause delays. For example in Genesis
30:1 we read that while Rachel was yet to have children, she envied her sister Leah who was already having children. She was also fighting her husband Jacob, threatening that if he did not give her children, she would die. Those were negative attitudes. Other emotional attitudes such as jealousy and hate are all counterproductive and they all spring from the heart. That is why the Psalmist cautioned us in Psalm 24:3-4 that it is only those whose hearts are pure and whose hands are clean that are qualified to receive God’s attention. Until we overcome the works of the flesh through sanctification we may constitute the very enemy that causes delay in our own journey. If we turn our aggression against someone else as Cain did to Abel or as Rachel did to Leah, it would not solve any problem.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				In Galatians 5:19-21, Paul gave us a comprehensive list of the works of the flesh that could hinder us spiritually. We will do well to use them as a checklist for our spiritual audit from time to time. It is very easy to point an accusing finger to the enemies without when the enemies within are yet to be dealt with. Any of those works of the flesh can pose a hindrance to your advancement and constitute a force of delay in your journey. The most devastating effect of these enemies within is that they will hinder your fruitfulness in the spirit. When that occurs you will not be able to flow in the Spirit and when you cannot pick divine signals, you may not enjoy divine guidance. How much can the believer achieve and how far can he go without the help of the Holy Spirit. Without the presence and partnership with the Holy Spirit, we are ordinary. Infact that is when the enemies will have an upper hand just as it was with Samson. King Saul lost out totally when the Spirit of God left him. We cannot go far without the Holy Spirit. That is why we must guide against the works of the flesh and ensure that they do not dominate our lives.

				The first born of the whole world, Cain, lost out because of an enemy within. It was anger. God warned him expressly but he was deviant. Each time I remember how Moses lost the final ticket to lead the Israelites into the Promised Land, I am afraid. You mean God could resist the man He gave the wonderful testimonies about in Numbers 12:3 and 7 and turn away from him by serving him summary dismissal? The enemy within that stopped Moses was anger. It was an inherited arrester. It came all the way from Levi and hunted the destiny of Moses. We must watch the enemy within. Rejoice in the Lord.
