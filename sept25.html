            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: 1 Samuel 2:12-17 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: 1 Cor. 15:33</strong> <br>                         
Be not deceived: evil 
communications corrupt 
good manners.</code></pre>

				Yesterday we considered the impact which people of negative influence have in our lives. They are people whose characters could taint your own and who may cause you to end up in life either as an unfulfilled individual or as an outright failure.
				<br /><br />
				The two sons of Eli the priest shall be our focus today. They were described as the wicked sons of Eli. They committed sins with impunity and it appeared that no one could correct them. The Bible tells us nothing about their mother, unlike the case of the young Samuel who grew up with those boys in the same house of the priest. The mother of Samuel used to bring for him a new garment year after year which means (spiritually speaking) renewal. Someone was checking up on Samuel and examining his life to curb his excesses and instruct him the way of the truth. Both the sons of Eli were recalcitrant and remained so until Proverbs 29:1 became a manifestation in their lives in practical terms.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Samuel must have found grace which helped him to put himself under self–control just like the case of Joseph. Recall that Joseph also had a housemate Potiphar’s wife, who delighted in defiling a young man. She was an evil company to keep. The experiences of both Samuel and Joseph should give encouragement to young children who are either separated from both parents or have only one parent with them. Such children should not let the devil take advantage of them. If Joseph could stand in righteousness from the age of 17 until thirty, it means that you too can survive the temptations of that stage of life and emerge a great man in the end. Just take the posture of Joseph and Samuel and stay with God. If you abide with Jesus, He will be with you and see you through. Amen.
				</p>
				
				<p>	
When the children of God identify a Terah around us, they should detach from such a person, by wisdom. They should do it prayerfully, asking God for wisdom. If your Terah is your husband or wife, then that is a major cross you have to bear. You can pray through and see a turnaround in him or her since you must not divorce. May God’s grace be sufficient for all such brethren all over the world today. Through divine wisdom, you shall not end your life’s journey in disaster. Rejoice in the Lord.
