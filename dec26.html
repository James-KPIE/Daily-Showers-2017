            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: 2 Cor. 5:17-20 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: 1 John. 3:9</strong> <br>                         
Nicodemus answered
and said unto him,
How can these things
be?</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				<b>A man is a sinner not because he sins, but he sins because he is a sinner.</b> This is a major truth that we all need to understand because there are many people who think they are innocent and deceive themselves that they don’t need to be saved from their sin. It is the lie of
the devil. Our Lord Jesus Christ told the Jews that the devil was a liar
from the beginning (John 8:44). Self deception is the shortest route to self-destruction. Sin is inherent in every person who is born into this world because we were all inside Adam as seed when he sinned and the seed inside of him (all of us) became corrupted by his sin. Adam was created in the image and likeness of God (His holy image and likeness of His purity), but he fell into sin, the son which was born to him thereafter was not born in the likeness of God but in the likeness of Adam. The nature of the sin of Adam was transferred to his offspring (Genesis 5:3). Sin has tainted every person who is born into this world ever since.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Jesus Christ was manifested to destroy the works of Satan (1 John 3:8). The core priority of Satan is to keep man in the bondage of sin so he could manipulate such a person all his lifetime. A person who is not yet set free from sin will be in the bondage of fear – the fear of tomorrow, the fear of the neighbour, the fear of the unknown, the fear of the night and so on, all the days of his life. The purpose of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ is to deliver them who through fear of death were all their entire lifetime subject to the bondage (Hebrew 2:15). The presence of Christ in you will expel all fear.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				A transformed life is the goal of redemption. Salvation does not just lead to an adjustment of lifestyle, it brings total transformation, it produces a new man, a man who is new in nature and the newness shows in all he does and in all his relationships. Transformation which comes through the saving blood of Jesus culminates in a turnaround that is visible to all. We don’t announce the changes that we experience through salvation. On the contrary, such changes announce us to our world and friends, colleagues, neighbours and relations all behold such changes and know that it is a radical departure from the life this newly saved man or woman used to live. If you have not been saved yet, turn to Jesus today, confess your sin, accept Him as Saviour and be saved. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
