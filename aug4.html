            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Rom. 9:15</strong> <br>                         
For he saith to
Moses, I will have
mercy on whom I will
have mercy, and I
will have compassion
on whom I will have
compassion.</code></pre>

				<p>The second thing the Lord will do when He decides to favour a person is to show mercy. None of us can merit the favour of God. He favours us because of His mercy towards us. All of us who enjoy God’s favour today acknowledge that it is all because we have obtained the mercy of God. It is the mercy of God that conveys His favour into our lives so that when favour begins to work in our affairs, it causes people to wonder at us
				</p>
				
				<p>
It was mercy that Jacob received at Bethel on his way to Laban and everything turned around in his favour. If we read through Genesis 28:11-22 and Deuteronomy 32:10-13, we will be tempted to say that Jacob did not merit all the blessings of divine attention, divine partnership, divine provision, divine protection, divine preservation and divine fulfillment. God renewed His covenant with Jacob at Bethel and restored everything which his rascality during his early life made him to lose. The Lord connected him to the Abrahamic root of the covenant again by announcing to him: <blockquote>“I am the God of Abraham your father and Isaac.”</blockquote> Jacob got everything back because the mercy of God located him.				</p>
				
				<p>
Many of us who were raw sinners some years ago are enjoying the covenant blessing today because of the mercy of God. In our season of favour, it is mercy that gives motion to everything that moves in our lives. When favour comes, those things that have not been working will begin to work. That is when the lines fall unto us in goodly places and we ride in the joy of salvation. Favour terminates stagnation as the mercy of God makes divine help rush in our direction. When help comes in that order, it would appear as if God has just woken up suddenly and remembered what He had promised to do in our lives and He mobilized the forces in heaven and on the earth to begin to do them. During that season of favour, mercy adds speed to our journey and our little efforts may yield great results. It is all because the Lord has risen and shown us mercy for our appointed time for favour has come.				</p>
			

<p>
You can wait on the Lord and ask Him for His mercy and favour. He who obtains the mercy of God will become an unstoppable winner and the Lord will put a new song in his mouth. Rejoice in the Lord.
