            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Est. 4:16</strong> <br>                         
Go, gather together
all the Jews that are
present in Shushan,
and fast ye for me,
and neither eat nor
drink three days,
night or day: I also
and my maidens will
fast likewise; and so
will I go in unto the 
king,  which is not 
according to the law: 
and if I perish, I 
perish.</code></pre>

				<p>
				Fasting is not a weapon to manipulate God or to twist His will. However, over the centuries fasting has been employed by believers in Christ to seek divine intervention in averting an imminent danger or disaster or to upturn the plans of the wicked or to trust God to do the miraculous such as healing, deliverance or to supernaturally provide for the need of His people. Two days ago, we considered the supernatural supply of both flour and oil in the house of the widow (1 Kings 17:8-16). When the people of God set time aside to wait on God and on His word and the waiting is coupled with fasting, God moves in their direction to do the
supernatural. Sometimes, God will even show a sign of the coming intervention days before such a period of fasting is over. Fasting, in this regard, is a demonstration of total trust in God and God keeps the trust of His people.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Esther was desperate in her desire to see God intervene to save the Jews in Shushan. She had two strategies. The first strategy was to turn to God and this is very instructive for us. As the queen, Esther knew the laws of the palace and she was about to violate the laws that the queen should not walk into the king’s chamber, uninvited. However, through divine wisdom, Esther turned to God first before considering the risk of breaking the rules to enter into the king’s presence. In the past, we came to the conclusion, in this manual, that those who talk to God first will always get God to talk to men or to move men on their behalf. And that was what happened to Esther and her people. They instigated God through fasting and God responded by stirring up the heart of the king. Esther took the risk after the days of fasting were over and the risk paid off because God had gone ahead of Esther. The king granted her admission and a series of events and action took place in quick succession. Haman’s plot failed and he perished in the gallows which he had prepared for Mordecai. The Jews were set free from the jaws of death as the law which proclaimed their extermination and annihilation was abrogated by the king.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				God is still in the business of defending, protecting and preserving His own people. Fasting helps us to have an undivided focus on God in whom we trust and it gives strength to our prayers to make them effectual. Rejoice in the Lord.
