And to the angel of
the church in
Philadelphia write;
These things saith he
that is holy, he
that is true, he
that hath the key of
David, he that
openeth, and no man
shutteth; and
shutteth, and no man openeth;</code></pre>

					Every door has a key. We have one key that opens all doors when we enter into the theatre of supplication and that is the name of Jesus. We have considered the power of that one name. Today, we shall go into scriptures to find the key that opens each door of blessing that we shall consider. For example, we find from the various healings of our Lord Jesus Christ in Matthew 9:22 and 29 that our Lord Jesus Christ attributed the healing of those people to their faith in the power of God. In other words, the key to your
healing is faith. Indeed, faith is the key that unlocks all doors of impossibility. In Mark 9:23 Jesus Christ said: “If thou cans’t believe, all things are possible to him that believeth. For every transaction in God’s kingdom, faith is the key.

					The encounters which Jacob had with the Lord especially after he returned to the Lord at Bethel show us that there are keys that open the door to different blessings from God. To enjoy a particular blessing from God in your relationship with Him, you need a key. For God took delight in Jacob when He found him in the desert (verse 10) because Jacob used the key of seeking God. In Isaiah 55:6, God’s word says: “seek ye the Lord while He may be found, call upon Him while He is near.” Amos 5:4 reads: “for thus saith the Lord unto the house of Israel, seek ye me, and ye shall live.” In Deuteronomy 32:10, God began to guide Jacob because he used the key of submission. The Lord is our great guide but we must submit to Him (James 4:7). In the same verse (10) Jacob enjoyed God’s shepherding because he used the key of trust (Psalm 37:5). God also began to direct Jacob because he now humbled himself (Psalm 35:9). Jacob also enjoyed divine lifting (God made him to ride on high places) ascending to verse 13 as Jacob used the key of total dependence or reliance on God. This time around, Jacob was not going to supplant anyone again. He also enjoyed divine abundance because he used the key of obedience (Job 36:11). Obedience is the key to abundance in the kingdom. Finally, Jacob became wiser (honey makes wise-Isaiah 7:15) because he used the key of learning which also required humility.

					Those eight keys in the hand of Jacob fetched him a total turnaround and a complete change of story. A former rascal became a spiritual heavyweight and a single man became a nation. Rejoice in the Lord.
