            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: 2 Tim. 2:2</strong> <br>                         
And the things that thou 
hast heard of me among 
many witnesses, the same 
commit thou to faithful 
men, who shall be able 
to teach others also.</code></pre>

				<p>Our commitment to the enlargement of God’s kingdom on the earth must not be limited to our own generation. Great Kingdom ambassadors are always mindful of nursing someone as a disciple who they will impact and ‘pour’ themselves into for the purpose of furthering the kingdom agenda in the next generation. In the Old Testament, we discovered David to be a leader who was interested in the future of
other young men around him. David invested in them and made them useful not only for themselves but for their generation. Those young men were disenchanted, disoriented and discontented fellows when David picked them up but they became mighty men who went to battles with David and were victorious. They became statesmen in their own right because David could see to the next generation.
<br /><br />
It has been said that for every Moses, there must be a Joshua and that for every Paul there must be a Timothy. We found Elisha coming strongly behind Elijah. Joshua was a gentle deputy commander in the army of Israel and he served under Moses with all sense of loyalty. He never betrayed his master. He did not get involved in the conspiracy or the rebellion of Korah, Dathan and Abiram or in the uprising that followed Miriam and Aaron’s criticism of Moses. It paid up for him when Moses transferred the baton to him first by laying hands on him for the impartation of wisdom according to Deuteronomy 34:9. Joshua led Israel to posses the Promised Land and gave inheritance to the tribes that were yet to obtain their inheritance under Moses. Joshua was a successful leader of Israel who aimed to direct Israel in the path of righteousness.

				Humility is required of men and women who will carry the banner of the gospel into the next generation. Elisha was an example of a servant who was so humble under his master and mentor. He practically served as a servant much more than a deputy. Little wonder the honour of a higher calling beckoned on him and he took over the mantle from Elijah with huge success.

We must be deliberate about raising disciples, not for our own sake, not to perpetrate our names but to further the work of the kingdom. We must begin by influencing our own children in the way of the kingdom and then reach out to other young people around us. That is the way to accomplish transgenerational expansion. Rejoice in the Lord.
