And said, If thou wilt
diligently hearken to the
voice of the LORD thy
God, and wilt do that
which is right in his
sight, and wilt give ear
to his commandments,
and keep all his
statutes, I will put none
of these diseases upon
thee, which I have
brought upon the
Egyptians: for I am the
LORD that healeth thee.</code></pre>

				We have the promises of God to heal us and to keep us healthy all over the scriptures. This is because He desires that we are healthy. In 3 John 2, John the beloved echoed the mind of Jesus which told us that He wishes that our soul prospers and that we be in health. Healthy living is God’s desire for us and through the scriptures He has released healing to us as promises which shall be performed upon our obedience. Let us note that everywhere we find a promise in the scripture, we must search for the condition for its fulfillment. Once we obey a condition which is attached to a promise, God is committed to perform. The reason is simple. God is bound by His own word. That is why Numbers 23:19 ask in part whether God has said anything and
would not do it or He has spoken a thing that He would not make good. When He speaks, it is done (Psalm 33:9).
				</p>
				
				<p>
				To stand on the promises of God by faith alone may not be enough where God has laid down conditions which we must obey. Exodus 15:26 and Deuteronomy 7:14-15 demand that we hearken unto the voice of the Lord and obey His commandments, then the promise of good health and healing follows. God has no problem with the performance of His word. The trouble is whether our obedience will be complete. It is also our responsibility to find the promise on the pages of scriptures as well as what we must do to turn each promise to a covenant between us and God for His performance. Obedience is the secret to a life of peace and comfort in Christ. To delay your obedience is to delay divine performance.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The Bible consists of the promises as information for us in some cases. Where that is the case we need to search for the revelation that will help us to gain access into their fulfillment. For example in Matthew 7:8 the word of God simply says that we should ask and receive. It does not end there. That is information. If we read further in Matthew 21:22 we find a revelation for the activation of the power to receive when we ask. This latter scripture says we shall receive whatever we ask if we believe. Another example is found in Psalm 92:14 which says the righteous shall be fat and flourishing. How? Proverbs 11:25 gives us the answer – it is the liberal soul that shall be made fat. Whenever we find the revelation and take action based on it we provoke the release of the blessing which the promise carries. That goes for our healing too. Rejoice in the Lord.
