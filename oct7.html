            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Job 22:27</strong> <br>                         
Thou shalt make thy prayer 
unto him, and he shall hear 
thee, and thou shalt pay 
thy vows.</code></pre>

				<p><b>The instruction you follow today determines the future you create for yourself.<b> Those who ignore divine instruction may postpone divine visitation and when a man misses divine visitation he may suffer devastation. Each time Israel went to battle without God they lost the battle. Preceding such experiences was the disobedience of Israel to
God’s instructions, the punishment for which was God selling them out to their enemies such as the Assyrians, the Philistines or the Babylonians.
<br /><br />
Jesus Christ our Lord told us in John 15:5 that without Him we can do nothing. Therefore, when we miss His support we experience delay in the accomplishment that we seek to achieve. When Israel left Egypt and commenced their journey to the promised land, Moses told God specially to give them the assurance of divine presence as they went along the way. As long as they obeyed divine instructions, they made progress. But they were slowed down whenever they rebelled against God. At such times the Lord handed them over to their enemies.
<br /><br />
Those who seek to achieve success through cunning and fraudulent methods often find out in the long run that it pays to play according to the rules. My mentor once said that in the school of success short cuts are the longest routes. I often wonder how cheaters feel when they have ‘achieved’ success. Such a result is one which they cannot truly celebrate and whatever project they want to build on such unrighteous foundations may not succeed.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				When we follow divine instruction, God follows us into what we do as a result of that instruction. Furthermore, our confidence in God is boosted when we abide by the instructions of the Almighty. There will be safety, all things will work in our favour, men and women will support our vision and the Lord abide with us every inch of the journey. Even when things go wrong temporarily, we are not dismayed because we follow instructions and we are persuaded that it will turn out well.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				When we follow instructions, we are assured that God will make us, that is, He will build us up and empower us to succeed. He told the disciples to follow Him so that He would make them. To follow instruction is an act of humility and Proverbs 15:33 says humility will always command honour. Those who follow divine instructions are less likely to suffer delay. Rejoice in the Lord.
