            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Deuteronomy 7:7-15 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Exo. 15:26</strong> <br>                         
And said, If thou wilt 
diligently hearken to the 
voice of the LORD thy God, 
and wilt do that which 
is right in his sight, 
and wilt give ear to his 
commandments, and keep all 
his statutes, I will put 
none of these diseases upon 
thee, which I have brought 
upon the Egyptians: for I 
am the LORD that 
healeth thee.</code></pre>

				The original plan of God for man was to make man whole, not needing to be healed, but sin made man vulnerable to sickness and infirmity. Until the fall in the Garden of Eden, no sickness was recorded because the original nature of man had not ‘fallen.’ God had positioned Adam and Eve above the devil until they fell into sin. Death was already in existence before the fall too but its power was not activated. Death does not only kill to take life out of a person but it has other agents such as sicknesses and infirmities by which certain parts of the human body and mind may be afflicted. When that happens, the man who was created to be well becomes ill.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				God has made provisions for the healing of man in the Bible because He is a gracious God. At the beginning God did not want man to fall into sickness. This is clear from Exodus 15:26 and the passage we read in Deuteronomy 7. God said He would take sickness away from our midst. He also promised not to allow the sicknesses that afflicted the Egyptians to come upon us. The understanding from those passages of scripture is that a man who is not attacked by sickness needs no healing. That state in which a man needs no healing is the state of wholeness, wherein a man is made whole. By faith we can all dwell in that state. Purity and holiness can take a person there just as obedience can guarantee wholeness too. Through faith we can believe God for a sickness–free life and there are believers who enjoy that blessed privilege in Christ and have not needed to be healed of any sickness for decades. God abides with them as their Health Maintenance Manager (the Lord that healeth–stays with them to keep them in a state of healthiness).
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Our spiritual mentality must align with the provision God has made for our spiritual and physical well–being in the scriptures. If a person expects to be sick from time to time, that is what he or she will get. We must believe in what God has said absolutely without admitting anything to the contrary. That is how to access wholeness which is the heritage of all believers through the restoration which redemption provides for us. Rejoice in the Lord.
