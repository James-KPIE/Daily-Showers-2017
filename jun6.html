            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: 1 Sam. 16:7</strong> <br>                         
But the LORD said
unto Samuel, Look
not on his
countenance, or on
the height of his
stature; because I
have refused him: for
the LORD seeth not
as man seeth; for
man looketh on the
outward appearance,
but the LORD
looketh on the heart.</code></pre>

				The Almighty God checks out our heart to validate the genuineness of our actions. That is a great lesson we should learn from the story of the woman who came to pour oil on Jesus and wipe His feet with her hair. In one version of the Bible, the heading for this passage of scripture is <b>A Sinful Woman Forgiven.</b> In verse 37, it is expressly stated that this woman was a sinner who learned that Jesus Christ had come to take some time off in the house of a Pharisee. Even the very act of Jesus visiting a Pharisee would have angered some other religious zealots. However, even the Pharisee
whom Jesus had visited cast a doubt on the genuineness of the spirituality of Jesus for allowing a sinner to touch Him. Religion brings all manners of contradictions. And that is why Jesus Christ did not come to preach <b>religion</b> but His mission was and is to re-establish the lost <b>relationship</b> between God and man and to restore God’s kingdom on earth.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Our Lord Jesus Christ told whoever cared to listen that He saw love behind the actions of this woman who was called a sinner. It was the prerogative of the Almighty God to reckon the woman righteous just as He reckoned Abraham as being righteous through his faith. The woman knew she had nothing to qualify her to be worthy in the Lord’s presence other than to surrender her whole life in worship. She perceived that if she laid it all down without withholding anything from her Maker, she might receive a pardon for all her sinfulness and she got it. That is the efficacy of grace. Just as we observed yesterday, the law would disqualify the best of men whereas grace qualifies the worse of men. May the Lord give us understanding of the depth and the height of grace.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Worship is an act of total surrender unto God. A penitent act may be deduced from our emotions without any utterance from our mouths. God is searching for those whose hearts are connected to Him in love as a response to the love which He had shown to us before we ever knew Him. However deep the expression of our love, it is only a reaction and a response to the unfathomable love of God which Jesus Christ expressed in His sacrificial death on the cross at Calvary. God’s ways are higher than our ways and His ways are past finding out. The acceptable worship must express love to our Saviour. Rejoice in the Lord.
