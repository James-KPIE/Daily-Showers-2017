            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Jere. 50:5</strong> <br>                         
They shall ask the
way to Zion with
their faces thither
ward, saying, Come,
and let us join
ourselves to the
LORD in a perpetual
covenant that
shall not be
forgotten.</code></pre>

				The believer’s life is a life of denials. However, the benefits of the kingdom are also attached to those sacrifices. We are on the series on how to provoke supernatural intervention. I know some people who were saved from terrible motor accidents because God remembers His covenant in which such people have been active over sometime. On a few occasions, I have used our Bible passage for today as the intercessory prayer for some dearly beloved
brethren in their hours of difficulty. I simply asked God to let Psalm
20:1-4 speak in their situations. And bless God, our covenant-keeping God, He did.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Among the covenant practices outlined yesterday was that of taking care of our parents. I know brethren who, apart from God, can only point to the prayers and prophecies of their parents over their lives as what has brought them to where they are today. Ultimately every blessing is traceable to God because He is our Source but parental blessing moves God to open doors of peace, prosperity and long life to us, according to Exodus 20:12. Among the Ten Commandments, only this commandment carries a promise. Those who are wise will not joke with their obedience to that commandment.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				I told our brethren in the church a few days ago that not all believers go through hardship. You can break the curse of hardship through covenant practice. Every covenant practitioner is entitled to a covenant season of jubilee, where struggles cease. Those who have devoted themselves to covenant practice for an unbroken period of seven years and then multiplies of seven years are entitled to a season of liberty from perennial struggles (read Leviticus 25:8-12). There is a season of reward and it is called jubilee. Two years ago, the Lord graciously built another house for my family through a strange order of events and I went to God to ask why He chose to favour us that way. God referred me to exactly fourteen years previously when we surrendered our first house under construction and it was sold along with other brethren’s sacrifices to roof His church building.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We need to be sensitive to the calendar of God for our lives. His covenant calendar is superior to man’s number of years. Your obligation is to stay under the perpetual covenant and watch the covenant-keeping God perform. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
