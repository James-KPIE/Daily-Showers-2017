            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Psalm 33:1-17</h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Ps. 33:9</strong> <br>                         
For he spake, and it 
was done; he commanded, 
and it stood fast.</code></pre>

				<p>
				One of the ways God solves problems is to speak to the problem as He did in Genesis 1:3. God speaks to anything He desires to change and everything He speaks to responds to His voice. He is sovereign and everything in heaven, on the earth and underneath the earth are subject
to His power. For example, in Mark 4:39, Jesus Christ our Lord spoke to a great storm and there was great calm. The beauty of the Lord speaking to any situation is that it brings total solution and such a solution is permanent.
<br /><br />
The sound of the voice of the Lord breaks any barrier to accomplish its purpose. In John 11:43, the Lord Jesus spoke to dead Lazarus to come forth. He did not address death because he did not need to negotiate with death for the release of Lazarus. When we are filled with the Holy Spirit, we can also manifest in the supernatural to issue commands that no force on earth can resist. Our Lord Jesus told the disciples in Luke 21:15 that He would give them a tongue and authority which the enemy cannot gainsay or resist.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We can carry the advantage of the speaking voice of God into every other realm in our kingdom experience. For example, we can speak whatever we desire into existence because we have the power of life and death on our tongue according to Proverbs 18:21. The Lord spoke the things He created into existence and we must not be afraid to call forth those things that be not as though they were (Romans 4:17). You can engage the power of prophecy to call forth your healing and other blessings. It is amazing what God does when we dare to speak. God spoke to Abraham and said that by the same season next year, Isaac shall be born (Genesis 18:10). In 2 Kings 4:16, Elisha operated in the power of the Holy Spirit to declare that the woman of Shunem would have a child by the next year. Elisha had spoken in 2 Kings 3:17 that the river would overflow by the next morning whereas everywhere was dry as at the time he spoke. Things turned out exactly as he had spoken. In 2 Kings 7:2, Elisha also spoke economic turnaround in Samaria and it happened overnight.
				</p>
				
				<p>	
He that is born of God is above all, by faith. We are supernaturally positioned in the above region according to John 3:31 and we must continue to exercise our authority in that order. Rejoice in the Lord.
