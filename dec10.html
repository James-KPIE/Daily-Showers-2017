            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Eph. 5:22-24 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Eph. 5:22</strong> <br>                         
Wives, submit yourselves
unto your own husbands,
as unto the Lord.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				The word of God is balanced. Just as the love of the husband for the wife is first foremost a responsibility under God, the submission of the wife to her husband is exactly in the same order. Our memory verse for
today makes that clear. Wives are to submit to their husbands “as unto the Lord.” That means every wife also looks beyond her husband’s ‘behaviour’ to submit to him. The ‘submission’ does not connote ‘slavery.’ For the wife who is mature and spirit-filled, submission is a management position. No woman can manage her husband if she does not respect him. A woman who honours her husband in words and in action, who cares for him as if he is her first baby, dresses for him and would do everything to make him comfortable will find a place in her husband’s heart. There is always trouble when caution is thrown to the winds and the husband is not made the king in the home. <b>Wisdom will tell us that when you make your husband the king in the home you are automatically the queen and you will occupy your throne there without struggling.</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The combined effect of the responsibilities of the husband and the wife well discharged is that a godly home will emerge. In such a home there is peace. In the home the power of God through the presence of God will give them victory over challenges and the praise of the dwellers in the home will continually attract divine provisions. Children who are raised in such an environment will be great assets to the society. A home where people always quarrel leaves the children with a sense of insecurity and mistrust whereas a home where there is peace and love builds in the child compassion and care and trust. Husbands and wives will behave well if they find time to think on the multiplier effects of what goes on in their homes.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The counsel to the wife therefore is that she must engage in violent submission. Both the husband and the wife must not insult one another in the public. Neither must they fight or quarrel in the presence of their children. In all things, God should be considered first. What we may do that will offend God must be avoided. Peace with God is the security for our destiny. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
