            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Jer. 32:17</strong> <br>                         
Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou 
hast made the heaven and 
the earth by thy great 
power and stretched out 
arm, and there is nothing 
too hard for thee:</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				The God of solutions is the God of restoration. He has shown to us right from the times of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob that whatever the enemy was permitted to take from His people can be restored by Him. God is unlimited in power and His power is subject to nothing but everything and every situation is subject to His power. In Genesis 20:2, Abimelech the king of Gerar took Sarah the wife of Abraham. In verse 3,
God came to the king at night and said to him in a dream <blockquote>“Indeed you
are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man’s wife.”<blockquote> The king had to restore Sarah to her husband with a lot of gifts. Abraham became richer overnight because somebody made an attempt to take his wife, ignorantly. The Lord watches everything that pertains to us.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				It was the people of Gerar who also hindered Isaac’s business in Genesis 26 as they filled the wells which his servants dug with earth and seized some until the unlimited God stepped in and Isaac prevailed over them. In an amazing turnaround which only heaven can work out, Isaac prospered so much that he became the envy of a whole nation. This same unlimited God visited Jacob in the cottage of Laban where he was practically enslaved for about twenty years until he cried to the Lord for help. His cry was expressed in his agony in Genesis 30:30. Then he pleaded his righteousness and heaven heard him (Genesis 30:33). In a swift response from heaven an idea struck his heart and within a short period there was a massive wealth transfer in favour of Jacob from Laban. When any covenant child is oppressed, he should be patient while he petitions heaven and the God of restoration will show up.
				</p>
				
				<p>
The nation of Israel was rebellious several times but God was patient with them because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. God had handed them over to the Philistines, to the Midianites, to the Babylonians at different times. Then Israel would repent and would call on God again and He would deliver them. We must not follow after the stubbornness of the Israelites because it is better to remain free without going into captivity again once we are saved. The message of our Bible passage for today is to underscore the ability of the Almighty God to restore our glory in the same location where we suffered shame and reproach. May that be your testimony. Rejoice in the Lord.
