				We could not expatiate much on the name of Jesus yesterday as we endeavoured to capture the essence of the series we are considering now. The conclusion we drew yesterday is important because we must know how to place emphasis on knowledge. In Isaiah 5:13, Hosea 4:6 and John 8:32, we see the
great value of knowledge. However, we need to distill wisdom from knowledge and hold unto principles therefrom, that will give us a hold on life in different areas. Moreover, it is the doing that gives effect to our knowing.<br /><br />
The greatest thing that can happen to man on earth is to be saved and make it to heaven ultimately. The Bible tells us that it is only by the name of Jesus that we can be saved. It is only His blood, not the blood of goats or rams that can make a man clean from the stain of sin. It is the same blood that can make a man escape from the sting of sin. Jesus Christ is the only One who came from heaven to the earth and announced that He came from the Father in heaven. Every other self–acclaimed leader of any other religion was born like any of us and made themselves leaders in the various philosophies they could propagate first, just as scientists over the years came up with different scientific theories.<br /><br />
Today, many people who belong to the other religions wrestle with this vital truth but thank God that day by day God is showing His mercy to people all over the globe this truth that salvation is in the name of Jesus only and they are being saved by the power in the blood and in the name of Jesus. Jesus Christ is the only One who laid His life down for the sin of mankind. Every other self–proclaimed leader of any religion who lived could only go to the Father through Jesus Christ who also created all of them. Christ did not come as a religious leader. He came as the Saviour of the world. Infact, He fought religion in order to turn the hearts of people to God. Jesus did not come to propagate religion but He came to restore the relationship between man and God which was broken through sin. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
