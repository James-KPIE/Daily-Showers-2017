            <h4 align="right">Thu. Feb. 16, 2017</h4>
            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Luke 16:10-13 </h3>
            <pre><code> M.V: Pro. 27:18 <br>                         
Whoso keepeth the
fig tree shall eat the
fruit thereof: so he
that waiteth on his
master shall be
honoured.</code></pre>There are three major rewards which a servant earns for serving his master faithfully. He earns the agreed remuneration which I will call the tangible compensation. He earns two other rewards which are intangible. One of them is called goodwill. This is an accumulation of the commendation of the servant who serves well.<br>When it builds up, it often fetches such a servant a good compensation in the future and may open a greater door of opportunity. A senior officer in a corporation in Nigeria had to relocate to the United States on promotion. When he settled down in the U.S., he found out that he needed a driver. His mind went to the driver who used to work with him in Nigeria and had served him well. The young man received an unexpected invitation to move to the United States. That is what faithfulness in serving another person may fetch you. According to the driver, he never dreamt of leaving the shores of Nigeria. Who says faithful service is not rewarding!<br><br>God is the ultimate rewarder and His reward goes beyond the financial and the material. God always remembers how we serve. He never forgets. When we serve other people, we must do it with the fear of God because we serve God by serving other people. That is why Colossians 3:17 has become our frequent reference scripture in the series we are doing on kingdom covenant reward system. You must handle that business which belongs to your boss as if it is your own. That is what the Bible teaches. And we must do it.<br><br>Faithfulness is the gateway to abundant blessing according to Proverbs 28:20. Faithfulness at work is an indication of self-respect and a proof of personal integrity. It does not matter how other people around you are working, you owe yourself a duty to stand out in the manner in which you do your work. It is a good ambition to be the best worker in your establishment, especially if you seek to bring glory to God in that respect. Whatever happens, handle each job as if it is your personal job. Give it the best you can give and be the best you can be at it. That is the requirement under the kingdom covenant reward system. Rejoice in the Lord.<div
