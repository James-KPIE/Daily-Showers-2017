            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Matthew 19:13-15</h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Matt. 19:14</strong> <br>                         
But Jesus said, Suffer
little children, and forbid
them not, to come unto
me: for of such is the
kingdom of heaven.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				Many of those who followed Jesus were not converted. Quite a number of those who used to surround Him were selfish and inconsiderate. Many times they wanted to shield away Jesus Christ from those who needed His attention. You will recall that when blind
Bartimaeus was shouting to catch the attention of Jesus those fellows asked him to shut up. Thank God it was his own day and grace got him to the presence of Jesus and he got his sight restored. Thank God for those who became desperate enough to brace the odds and press through the crowd to get to Jesus, like the woman with the issue of blood and the leper. That woman went a step further by touching the helm of His garment and she was healed instantly. The leper broke the law of Moses by worshipping Jesus and he was healed too.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The children who wanted to get to Jesus to be prayed for and to receive from Him were prevented until He intervened to ask that they make room for those children. In many cultures, children are made to suffer certain disadvantages. Their cut of meat at the meal would be very tiny while that of their parents who do not need meat as much as the children do, would be mouthful. Jesus demonstrated to us that children, like the adults must have the same access to the privileges and benefits of the kingdom. Praise God Jesus Christ taught everyone a lesson though that encounter.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Children are innocent. They are more obedient than the adults because they do not know as much as adults know. Where many of us who are grown up will be finding all kinds of reasons why a divine instruction should be ignored, a child just follows the instruction. Do you know that children can evangelize more than adults? Yes, they can because they are more friendly. Their minds are not poisoned against anyone. May God forgive many of us who are parents. We teach those young children to love our friends and hate our perceived enemies. Some white parents discourage their children (who don’t see the pigmentation of the skin as a barrier to friendship) not to go out to play with black children in the neihgbourhood and vice-versa. Jesus Christ warns us to return to the mentality of the children so we can relate with tender, loving, unbiased mind in order to make heaven. We must also not discriminate against children. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
