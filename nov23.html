            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Showers: 1 Cor. 4:6-13 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: 1 Cor. 4:10</strong> <br>                         
We are fools for Christ's
sake, but ye are wise in
Christ; we are weak, but
ye are strong; ye are
honourable, but we are
despised.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				We shall take one more day to press on further in the need to be obedient like children. Please recall that in our Bible text for yesterday, Jesus Christ said we cannot see the kingdom of God unless we become like children. That is speaking of being born again in essence. When we are born again, the heart of stone is removed from us and it is replaced with the heart of flesh. The heart of stone is incorrigible, stubborn and
thrives in destructive and counter-productive self-will. It is the mind of a man who is proud, full of self and cannot be corrected. Such a heart does not forgive and it is carnal and insensitive to the things that are spiritual. Of course such a mind cannot perceive spiritual truths and cannot be ruled by the same.
<br /><br />
Unlike the stony heart, the heart of flesh is gentle, obedient, listening and can be entreated. For a believer, the heart of flesh is a heart to which God can speak. It is a heart that obeys divine instructions even when they are uncomfortable. Such a mind is transformed and just like the heart of Jesus Christ our Lord. It is a mind that has come to do the will of God. And that is where the foolishness comes in. To the carnal mind, things like payment of tithe, bringing our first fruit to the Lord, giving to the poor (even when all your own needs have not been met) are foolish acts.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Those of us who turn to Christ three hundred and sixty degrees upon being born again have been told that we have a little touch of being mentally deranged. Yes, we agree. Our foolishness is speaking peace to the whole world. Our madness is reconciling sinners to the holy Creator. We are mad for Jesus but we are not radicalized for the devil to kill and maim, to bomb planes carrying hundreds of innocent people and to set a whole nation into orgies of violence. I will rather be foolish for Jesus and be a promoter of peace to the end of the earth.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<b>Obedience is the foolishness of the wise and disobedience is the wisdom of the fool.</b> When we obey God we look foolish. When we decide, in the fear of God (Proverbs 16:6(b)) to prosper the way God will approve, rather than through corruption, we are foolish. When we refuse to walk through the open door which the devil opens (like the one which Potiphar’s wife opened to Joseph) we are considered foolish. However, one thing is certain the foolishness of righteousness will take us to heaven. Remain foolish for Jesus. Rejoice in the Lord.
