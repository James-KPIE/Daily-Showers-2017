				We shall consider a subject that I have captioned the power of one from today and for the next few days. Sometime ago in this manual, we took time to consider the power of two and we saw the tremendous advantages of unity at that level from the pages of the scripture. We want to consider the power of one
because many people, including Christians often run around to do so many things and to seek to live by so many doctrines that they get confused. The power of one may streamline your spiritual life and you may find out that you have been living a life of stress even though you are a Christian. I trust God to give us a better understanding as we embark on this journey. Amen.<br /><br />
God is simple. He is not complicated. I have found from a personal experience that only one issue may provide an answer to many other issues that may be giving us headache. Not very long ago, someone in our church suggested that we should teach about “the last days” as a follow–up to a series we had just finished in our Bible study. There is no problem with teaching Eschatology from year to year. I find out that this person was particularly afraid because of the evils of our time and was also very anxious for fellow Christians. This Christian, therefore, felt that much knowledge about the Beast, the Antichrist, the 666 number will stem the tide of Christian backsliding. I entirely agree. However, after deep thought, I came to the conclusion that a believer only needs to do one thing to make heaven after he or she has believed in Jesus Christ, and that is to live holy. What we do with what we already know is more important than to just keep on heaping up knowledge without applying it.<br /><br />
If you are saved by the blood of Jesus and you remain holy unto the Lord, even though you do not know all the Bible from cover to cover, you will be saved and you will escape the tribulations of the end time. We shall continue on the power of one name–JESUS, tomorrow. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
