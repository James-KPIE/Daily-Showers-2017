And the king loved
Esther above all the
women, and she
obtained grace and
favour in his sight
more than all the
virgins; so that he
set the royal crown
upon her head, and
made her queen
instead of Vashti.</code></pre>

					The case of Esther shows us how a single appearance can result in a life-long impact and lead to a breakthrough that will be celebrated for life. The contestants for the position of the queen were all prepared for the night when each of them would appear before the king. It was a night with the king which would signpost the story of the rest of the life of whoever the king chose. All the beauty contestants had gone through six months
of purification and an additional six months of beautification. All
that one year of preparation will wait for just one night to be rewarded. The preparations would be meaningless for those who would lose out and it would be rewarding for the one who became the king’s choice.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Esther was highly favoured right from the hands of the officer who was chosen to oversee her preparation. No one knew what exactly the king would look for to arrive at his judgment as to which of those virgins was the best. That is where favour plays out. Esther obtained favour with the king as soon as the king set his eyes on her and she became the queen. Favour distinguishes a person from the crowd and may even give unto him the blessing for which he or she may not be qualified. In the case of Esther, favour was on her side right from the time the contestants were chosen to contest. She was not a native of Shushan and her nativity could have disqualified her, but Mordecai warned her not to disclose her roots. No one raised it as an issue against her just as the background of Joseph was never an issue in his meteoric rise in Egypt. When favour is at work, God puts aside laws which would have disqualified a person.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					When Haman’s plot became unfolded and Mordecai had to call on Queen Esther to intervene, it was again a case of one make-or-mar appearance for Esther. She needed the permission of the king before she could go into the king’s chambers, otherwise, she risked facing untimely death. However, she got it and the one appearance saved all the Jews and she also made a case for Mordecai later. One appearance may separate between life and death. Rejoice in the Lord.
