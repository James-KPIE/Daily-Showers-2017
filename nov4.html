            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Romans 5:18-21</h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Romans 8:1</strong> <br>                         
There is therefore now
no condemnation to
them which are in
Christ Jesus, who
walk not after the
flesh, but after the Spirit.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				The mind of Christ is a very considerate one. Imagine that we have to face the consequences of all the sins we committed before our conversion. Imagine also that the record of our iniquities is not blotted out by God when we receive Jesus Christ as our Saviour, so that God keeps referring to them and deals with us according to the guilt for our former
sins. We would have been miserable. However, thanks be to God who
reckons us as not having sinned when we are born again through our justification. We are justified because God looks at us as if we have never committed any sin because He remembers our sins for which we have been forgiven no more. See Jeremiah 31:34 and Hebrew 8:12.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				I have met Christians who still labour under the guilt of their pre-conversion sins. It is because they lack an understanding of the word of God with reference to their redemptive status. The issue of justification is one of the pillars of our salvation experience. If God says He would remember my sins no more, why should I labour under its guilt any further. All the sins we commit are against God even though the acts or deeds may have different persons as their victims, yet once God has forgiven us, it is over. Some years after the conversion experience of Paul the apostle, he declared that he was not guilty of any man’s blood. That is true because he experienced forgiveness and justification. <b>However, it was a fact that he participated in the maiming and jailing of the persecuted believers before he was saved.</b> He was there giving approval and encouragement to those who stoned Stephen unto death. <b>The truth however is that the Saul who did all those evil ‘died’ on the way to Damascus.</b> The court of heaven sat on his case and entered a verdict of ‘no guilt’ when he was converted. He was discharged and acquitted of all charges against him.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Your case is exactly in that fashion too, thanks to the cross which Jesus endured until He finished the work for our salvation. God can no longer punish you for any of your past sins because it would offend the nature of God who would not support double jeopardy. You cannot be made to suffer for the same sin for which Jesus had been crucified. He bore the shame for our sins and in exchange for shame; He has brought glory for us. On the cross, Jesus exchanged our condemnation with confidence of citizenship in His kingdom. There is nothing more that we can or need to do for Jesus did it all. This is the second supernatural exchange that took place on the cross. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
