            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: 2 Cor. 5:12</strong> <br>                         
For we commend not
ourselves again unto
you, but give you
occasion to glory on
our behalf, that ye
may have somewhat
to answer them
which glory in
appearance, and not
in heart.</code></pre>

				It is possible to have charisma without character. That is why Paul had to stress the need for us to be careful not to be carried away by those outward acts which do not really prove the character of Jesus in our heart. As I concluded the write-up for yesterday, I was reminded of a little debate that went on in our class in the Bible College two decades ago. It was on the balance of charisma and character. After several comments, we came to the conclusion that <b>character is superior to charisma and that when we are gifted with charisma, we need character for its sustenance?</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				There are disturbing occurrences in the body of Christ today. Folks who claim to have received Christ but who are not tutored in the word and rooted in the same would quickly lose the spiritual fervor and begin to operate carnally. It takes a deep root in the word to produce the Christlike character that endures. We have the challenge of raising trustworthy, honest men and women of integrity in the body of Christ today. The decline in commitment to kingdom priority such as evangelism and soul-winning is due to the simple truth that consumerism is fast overtaking our zeal for spiritual exploit. We have not built that character that seeks to please God at all costs and which is desperate in losing all things so as to keep Christ.
				</p>
				
				<p>
The pursuit of power for any other purpose such as to show off that we are the miracle workers in town, to gain popularity, to earn the worship of other men or for financial and material gains, is rife in the church. That is not the purpose for which God would release power. Poor Simon. That guy gave his life to Christ and was baptized by the gentle Holy Spirit but he was not ‘broken’ in the spirit. So, his desires were still in the flesh. He wanted the power of the Holy Spirit, not for soul-winning, but for other reasons. Perhaps, he wanted to ‘show-off’ with the power. When power is released to such fellows what we shall have is charisma without character. That is the company of Gehazi who wanted to be in the ministry for gains, not for soul-winning. He was quickly dismissed by Elisha. <b>Christianity without character is mere caricature.</b> Let us focus on the purpose for which Jesus Christ offered His life on the cross and for that reason, ask for the power of the Holy Spirit and we shall not be denied. Rejoice in the Lord.				</p>
