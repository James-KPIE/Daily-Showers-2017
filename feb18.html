            <h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>
            <h4 align="right">Sat. Feb. 18, 2017</h4>
            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Genesis 1:27-31 </h3>
            <pre><code> M.V: Exo. 25:40<b style="color:red"></b> <br>                         
And look that thou
make them after their
pattern, which was
shewed thee in the
mount.</code></pre>Under the kingdom covenant reward system, God will only reward an excellent work. Excellence glorifies God and inspires people. Each of us must be committed to putting our best into whatever we do, whether for ourselves, for other people or for the<br>kingdom of God. We saw Jesus as the excellent One last month. He did all things well. Nothing could be added to whatever He did. Whatever Jesus Christ did was not finished half-way and could not be improved upon. Even today whatever situation God steps into by intervention, it becomes a perfect matter when He finishes. As children of God we take after our Father, so we must pursue excellence.<br><br>Excellence begins with how we take care of little things. How do you take care of your body and your home? How much do you care about your dressing as a child of God? Unknown to many of us, the way we dress sends good or bad signals to those who look at us. For example, there are dresses that glorify God and there are those that do not. The Bible speaks of the attire of a harlot in Proverbs 7:10. In the first place, proper dressing sends a signal that you believe in self-respect. Beyond that, excellence must show in the way we take care of our homes and the things we use everyday such as our cars. If you refuse to service the engine of your car when it is due, it means you are careless about excellence and you may not enjoy the car for a long time. You need to live with the maintenance culture of heaven. <b>You see, since God created you, you have not needed to change your hands or your legs or your eyes or your tongue because He maintains them for you</b>. If you cooperate with Him in avoiding unhealthy food and you maintain a healthy life-style, the organs He gave you will last for a life-time.<br><br>Excellence at home is very important. The English adage which says charity begins at home is very true. If you are rough and unkempt at home, it will reflect in the way you handle your work, ultimately. We can cultivate the excellent spirit. Our God is excellent and you can sign up for excellence. Rejoice in the Lord.<div
