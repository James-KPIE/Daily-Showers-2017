not, Abram: I am thy

					We want to touch a very important aspect of our Christian adventure today. A while ago, we considered the subject of singleness. The conclusion was that the strength of a man in a community of other fellows, particularly his strength of character is a function of his individual strength when he is single or alone with God. For example, if a young Christian fails to grow spiritually as an
individual before he enters into marriage, he will bring his spiritual weakness into the union. If left unchecked, his weakness will hurt his marriage and may ruin it ultimately. The same is true for a young lady who grows in a home where she is not groomed for the responsibilities of marital life. She may become miserable because she would naturally bring her shortcomings into the new home. <b>A person’s contribution to a corporate goal is a function of the values of his or her singleness.</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Closely linked to the issue of singleness is the fact that God’s audience starts from one and it is ultimately one. Check through the Bible and you will discover that God related with one person per time for different purposes. Noah was a single person chosen, for his assignment, by God to build the ark for the people and animals that would survive the flood. God called and brought out only Abraham (then Abram) as the only one in his family by divine sovereignty because, unlike Noah, Abraham was deep in idolatry just as the rest of his family. When God called Moses, he was the only audience God had, even though the call was for a national emancipation of a people who had been in slavery for over four hundred years. So, it runs through both the old and new testaments. Saul of Tarsus was in the company of other persecutors during his journey to Damascus when he, alone heard God’s voice. God’s audience is always one.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The implication of this truth is that, although we may find ourselves in the midst of thousands or millions of other people whether in the church or in a larger community, each of us can only make progress spiritually as a single person. If we recognize this truth, we should expect to relate with God as individuals. Most times people are lost in the crowd because they do not know that each one has to relate with God personally, though the fellowship with other brethren must not be forsaken. When last did God speak to you as a person? That is as far as it goes. Watch it. Rejoice in the Lord.
