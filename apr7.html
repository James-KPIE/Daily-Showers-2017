bread, and he did eat; and they made him
drink water;</code></pre>

					It is a common saying that no man is created as an island unto himself. Another song says that we need each other to survive. How true! There is a limit to every man’s knowledge. Naaman, the leprous general in the army of Syria did not know where to obtain the healing he desperately needed. Thank God
for the young Hebrew girl they had caught from Israel during their raid in that country. The ‘salvation’ of the general was in the hands of the Hebrew maid. If Naaman had ignored the advice of the maid,he, probably, would have died in his leprosy.

					person who appears to be of little consequence or influence may be the one God will use to usher you into your next level or breakthrough. God designed it to be so right from the beginning. God created Adam and made all things that he would need available to him. He created all that the man would need before He created him. However, God further provided for Adam a helpmate. The animals which God had created would not serve the purpose of a woman. And God did not give any other man the capacity to fulfill the natural roles of the woman. It takes some abnormality to think or propose otherwise. The company of animals can never be compared to the company of another human being. However well-off we may be, let us be thankful to God that He has surrounded us with other persons as helpers.

David and his company were instructed by the Lord to go after the Amalekites who had raided Ziklag when the army led by David went on another war campaign. David and the soldiers were well armed for the battle. However, they had no idea where to find the raiders God asked them to pursue. Nevertheless, God divinely organized a chance-meeting with an Egyptian who was tired and distressed. He was a servant to an Amalekite who left him behind in the course of their fighting because he (the Egyptian) fell ill. The youngman was brought to David, he was fed and he was refreshed until he became healthy enough to give them the information which led the army of David to swoop down upon the Amalekites where they had camped to enjoy the spoil of war. The army of David pounced on them, overpowered them and recovered all they had captured from Ziglag. May you find a pathfinder when you get to a cross road. Rejoice in the Lord.				</p>
