            <h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>
            <h4 align="right">Fri. Feb.24, 2017</h4>
            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Gen 22:1-8 </h3>
            <pre><code> M.V: John 4:23<b style="color:red"></b> <br>                         
But the hour cometh,
and now is, when the
true worshippers
shall worship the
Father in spirit
and in truth: for the
Father seeketh such
to worship him.</code></pre>Abraham was an addicted worshipper of God and that was his <b>thir</b>d credential which endeared him to God. As soon as God called him, he started by building an altar of worship where he would regularly commune with and worship God. He departed in obedience in Genesis 12:4. Then in Genesis 12:8, he built an altar of worship. In Genesis 13:4; he built another altar at Bethel. Then,<br>he moved on to the plain of Manre in Hebron and built another altar there according to Genesis 13:18. Abraham’s persistence at the altar was captured in Genesis 19:27, where the Bible says that Abraham got up in the morning to the place where he had stood before God. He had a regular place and time where he worshipped God.<br><br>We are all created for God’s pleasure and one of the best ways to bring pleasure to God is through worship. Worship is connecting to God soul-to-soul as it were. It is entering into a deep communion with the Father. We can cultivate deeper and more meaningful friendship with God via the altar. The altar is the place where the mortal interacts with the Immortal. The place of worship is the place where you go naked before your Maker and you pour your heart out to Him. On the altar, you don’t hide anything from Him. Upon the altar of worship as you open up to God, He opens up to you too. God loves to talk with us, not only to us. He wants to commune with us as a friend does with his friend. He longs for our fellowship with Him. God wants us to come closer and closer to Him so we can draw revelations and insights that make life easier for us.<br><br>The altar is a place of instructions. When you run with the instructions that comes from the altar, you will begin to command blessings of favour and victory and enjoy instant intervention from God. Life is cheap for the people of the altar because the altar is the place where ‘self’ is emptied and where we breathe in fresh breath of the Spirit. The altar is the breakfast room for champions. You too can follow the steps of Abraham. Rejoice in the Lord.<br><br><div
