            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Ex. 23:25</strong> <br>                         
And ye shall serve the LORD 
your God, and he shall bless 
thy bread, and thy water; and 
I will take sickness away from 
the midst of thee.</code></pre>

				The original well–being which pertained to bodily health under the blessing was in the form of wholeness or total health. Although God made provision for the healing of His covenant children in Exodus 15:26, God was concerned that His people shall enjoy wholeness in their bodily health. We have explained Exodus 15:26 as meaning that God stays with us, watches over
us to maintain our health. The word ‘healeth’ is a present continuous tense and it refers to a continuous exercise just as a husband should continue to groom his wife for life. Of course Jesus Christ is our husband as we are His church and the least He would do as a perfect example is to keep us healthy. That is why He did the work both for our salvation and our health simultaneously on the cross at Calvary (Read Isaiah 53:5 again).<br /><br />
Jesus desires that we have “wholeness” as opposed to our coming just to receive healing all the time. You are not a sick person who is looking for healing (if you are born again) but you are a healed citizen of the kingdom seeking to defend your healing. A perfect work has been done on Calvary concerning your health. Amen. Our mentality in the covenant will determine our status on earth. If you have a beggarly lifestyle without confidence in the efficacy of Christ’s work on the cross, you may continue to live like an abandoned child. It will not be God’s fault if you don’t lay claim on your covenant heritage of health which is wholeness. Jesus Christ would tell someone He had healed: “your faith has made you whole” (Matthew 9:22). Wholeness is God’s desired destination for us under the covenant. The consciousness of the little expose can keep you away from the hospital all your lifetime. God has the capacity to keep you whole. He created you perfect and no one can amend your being because you are a perfect work from the beginning.<br /><br />
Permit me to end this with a clarification. I do not advocate any opposition to seeking medical attention. No. I have just tried to bring us an assurance from God’s word what His perfect plan for us is. In His wisdom, He endowed the doctors with the wisdom to attend to our health. May God bless them. However, you can grow your faith and believe God for wholeness or total health as I do. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
