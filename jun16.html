            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Jere. 33:3</strong> <br>                         
Call unto me, and I will 
answer thee, and shew 
thee great and mighty 
things, which thou knowest not.</code></pre>

				Problems are not meant to scare us. Neither should we see challenges as an indication that God has turned away from us. Indeed, God stepped in to solve a problem and that led to the creation of this whole earth. In Genesis 1:2, The Bible says the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face
of the deep. So, God began to give shape to the earth by the things He created such as the light, the darkness, the waters, the dry land, the vegetation, the land and aquatic animals and so on. Out of a confused state of things came a well-ordered creation.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The difficulty of an earth without form was God’s opportunity to show forth the supernatural. We can also take advantage of the challenges that we face to provoke the supernatural. Incidentally, the problems we cannot solve are those ones that we take to God and when God steps in, He performs miracles. <b>Big problems therefore, present opportunities for big miracles.</b> When Jesus stepped in to speak to the storm according to Mark 4:39, there the great storm led to a great clam. The bigger the problem, the greater the miracle that we see in the solution that the Lord provides.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Daniel and the other wise men of Babylon faced a great challenge to find out what the dream of king Arioch was and the interpretation of the dream. This assignment or problem required a greater anointing than that of Joseph who interpreted the dreams of Pharaoh. The other wise men were already perplexed because the king had threatened to kill them if they could not unravel the puzzle. Meanwhile, the other wise men had concluded that the demand of the king could not be met by any ordinary man except by the gods. Thank God for Daniel who was divinely connected. He told the king to give him time. The time which Daniel asked for was a night time which he set aside to seek the face of God. In His faithfulness, God answered the prayers of Daniel and he got the revelation which unraveled the mystery and the king was so overwhelmed that he rose from his throne to worship Daniel (Daniel 2:46).
				<br /><br />
				Prayer is an instrument which we can use to provoke the supernatural to occur. That is why God has extended the grace for supplication and intercession to us that through prayer we are able to instigate heaven for the supernatural to occur. Rejoice in the Lord.
