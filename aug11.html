            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Matthew 9:36-38 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Matt. 9:38</strong> <br>                         
Pray ye therefore the
Lord of the harvest,
that he will send
forth labourers into
his harvest.</code></pre>

				<p>
				The focus and content of our prayer change with our level of maturity in our Christian walk. Mature Christians pray according to the will of God. They search the word for God to reveal His will to them and it forms the content of their prayer. Sometime ago we looked through the Bible to find God’s prayer
requests. The purpose was to open our eyes to the kind of prayers that God will definitely answer. And we have the understanding that when God’s prayer requests are at the top of our prayer lists, our personal requests will be granted because we have given attention to praying over God’s prayer requests first.
				</p>
				
				<p>Selfishness is a major challenge to overcome at the theatre of prayer. A sure way to overcome that challenge is to become selfless and refuse to be engrossed with our own desires. For good measure, the prayer for kingdom labourers who would prevent the harvest from decay is one of God’s prayer requests in the Bible. We find another one in Psalm 122:6. We are to pray for the peace of Jerusalem. Indeed, there is a promise attached to prayer on this particular request. The word of God says that those who love Jerusalem and pray for its peace shall prosper.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We should bring liberality to the altar of prayers. This will occur when we give attention to the intercession for other people’s needs, just as Abraham did when he prayed for the preservation of Sodom from imminent destruction. That was Moses posture too. We can hardly find one place where Moses prayed for food or for clothes or for money. He was sold out to seeking the interest of Israel whenever he went to God on Mount Sinai. He was there several times to intercede for the easily rebellious Israelites, that God would not destroy them. At a time, God even gave Moses the option of raising a new generation through his own line, after He wiped out the stubborn Israelites. However, Moses refused to accept that option, insisting that God should change His mind and forgive Israel, His chosen people.
				</p>
				
				<p>Job’s captivity was turned when he looked away from his gigantic problems and prayed for his friends (Job 42:10). Turn away from selfish prayers. Pray kingdom advancement prayers and God will attend to your personal requests faster. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
