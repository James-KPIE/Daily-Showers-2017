            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: James 4:7</strong> <br>                         
Submit yourselves
therefore to God.
Resist the devil, and he
will flee from you.</code></pre>

				Someone said many years ago that the word ‘no’ is an anointed word. It is my opinion which was expressed in an earlier edition of this manual that whether a man will end up in heaven or hell is a function of what he says
‘yes’ or ‘no’ to while he is here on earth. For example if you say ‘yes’ to Jesus and become a born again child of God who is redeemed by the saving blood of the Lamb- Jesus Christ the Saviour of the world and you keep saying ‘no’ to every allurement of the world and Satan, you will get to heaven. That is sure.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Violent ‘no’ means a total, irreversible resistance to a pressure which seeks to alter your determination or to vary your resolve. We have a great example of a man who said ‘no’ to such temptations in Joseph. The young man had left home where there were people who could monitor him. He was a slave in Potiphar’s house. It was demeaning for a loved son of a caring father to suddenly become a slave. He was no longer of any reputation socially. Then an elegant lady who was well-to do as a wife to an officer of Pharaoh came to tell him that he was not worthless after all. Getting along with the woman would ‘raise’ his social status and he would have a sense of importance! However, Joseph looked beyond all that and believed that God has not shown him the reversal of his great dream and so he would not let go or surrender to cheap enticement of the appeasement of the flesh. He met the wife of Pharaoh with a resolute no and he maintained that posture for the days or weeks that the temptation lasted. And God saw to it that he was rewarded with the glory which his dreams depicted.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				All of us, young and old, need the violent no in our journey of life. I once told our young girls in the church that if any useless man wants to mess them up sexually, they should resist with a violent no. Except in society or in a religion where there is no fear of God, a teenager has nothing to do with a man of the opposite sex at that age. I belong to the ‘old school’ of Christians who believe you should keep your purity until you are married. It does not matter how morally bankrupt this world may become; God’s holy standard will never change. Is there any temptation you are facing today – to steal or cheat or engage in corrupt practices or to lie or to abuse your office – say no. Resist with a no and the enemy will flee. Rejoice in the Lord.
