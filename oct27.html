He delivereth and rescueth, 
and he worketh signs and

				We shall close the series on <b>no more delay</b> with how God brought delays to us in some cases in the Bible so that we can tap into His anointing and replicate the same wonder in our lives. We are able to do that for three reasons. One, our God is still on the throne. He is the Lord who changes not (Malachi 3:6). Two, He has not lost His power, so whatever He did before; He still has the power to do. Three,
every testimony is a prophecy because the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy (Revelation 19:10). If you can connect by the spirit of faith, you can cause whatever the Lord had done to become your own experience too.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The end of delay in the life of Abraham shall be our focus today and tomorrow. Abraham’s case shows us that delay is not necessarily caused by sin or even unbelief. Abraham had separated himself unto God from idolatry. That is consecration. He became a man of the altar where he daily sanctified himself unto God (Genesis 19:27). He was not living in sin; he was enjoying the grace of God. Yet there was this delay in having children as a couple–himself and Sarah. His delay seems to be hereditary because the history of their family shows that the men in the family used to have their first child when they were in their thirties. But Terah shot the age up to seventy years and it appeared Abraham took it from there. Even Isaac also experienced some delay too. In Abraham’s case, he stood by faith until his season of change came. In his trying times he never spoke against God. He did not complain. He did not grumble. He was glorifying God. If you are experiencing any case of delay today, that is what you too should do. Do not form an alliance with people who will influence you to do otherwise. God has an appointed time for everyone. The wise thing to do is wait on Him during your trying time as Job resolved to do (Job 14:14).
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Abraham laughed last. Each time I read Genesis 21:1, I am filled with joy. This will be your own story very soon in Jesus name. God solved the problem of fruitlessness in the lives of Abraham and Sarah by giving them a creative miracle. The Almighty God re–created their bodies to give capacity for reproduction and effortlessly as they advanced age, Sarah went through conception and they had their son of laughter. You too can ask for your own creative miracle today. Rejoice in the Lord.
