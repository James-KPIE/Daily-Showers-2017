            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Psalm 102:11-21 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Ps. 102:13</strong> <br>                         
Thou shalt arise, and have 
mercy upon Zion: for the 
time to favour her, yea, 
the set time, is come.</code></pre>

				When God appoints a time to do a thing, we cannot hurry Him to break the time of His appointment. God has an agenda for everything He does and blessed be that man or woman who knows his or her own time of appointment for he or she shall be at peace and will not be troubled when other people are agitated over the same issues.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				I had an assistant pastor who worked with me several years ago. I asked him once or twice to go start a church but he said ‘no.’ He explained that he was pleased serving as an assistant minister for the time being at that time. About ten years later, when he felt his due time for that assignment had arrived, he went full length into it and has done so well. When Moses attempted to lead the Jews before the appointed time, it ended up as a failed effort. The Lord would have him trained and his training would start with the shepherding of his father–in–law’s flock at the backside of the desert. His preparation would last for forty years and then, at the appointed time, he would go to lead Israel out of Egypt, not as a solo personal effort but as a divine mandate. <b>A person who parades himself before his due time may face disgrace.</b> There is always an appointed time with God.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Our point of emphasis today is that God may remain silent if it is not yet His appointed time for what you want to do. The Lord told Abraham that the Israelites would spend four hundred years in a strange land before they would walk out of slavery. However agitated the Israelites might have been, they could not get out of Egypt until the appointed time. If prophets had bombarded heaven and the Israelites groaned relentlessly, God would be quiet all the same because, it was not yet the appointed time and there was nothing no one could do to hasten it.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Our Lord Jesus Christ warned us ahead of this end time. He said the persecutions would become so tough that the very elect may begin to waiver in faith. However, He also credited the Father with the power to shorten the time. And that is where we shall draw the curtain today, that the Father in heaven may shorten the time especially for those who have been under terrible persecution and help them to endure what they have to, according to His will. Rejoice in the Lord.
