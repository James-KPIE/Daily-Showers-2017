            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Deut. 26:19</strong> <br>                         
And to make thee
high above all
nations which he
hath made, in praise,
and in name, and in
honour; and that
thou mayest be an
holy people unto the
LORD thy God, as he
hath spoken.</code></pre>

				When you see a man who is lifted to the top by the hand of God, you will hear a story of favour from the Most High. When God favours you, He can lift you up without any effort of your own.
				A brother went for an interview for an executive position in a
bank. The panelists asked him three questions. Number one question
required him he to tell them his name. Number two was the position he applied for and number three was how much he wanted to be paid as his remuneration. Then, he was asked to return the following week. When he got there, he was told that the C.E.O. had resigned at the weekend and he was asked whether he would take the position. He said yes. He was told to resume on a certain date. On the day of his resumption, he was told by the Board that the former C.E.O resigned because he was offered a higher salary in another company and the Board had agreed to pay this new employee the same salary that the former C.E.O had just been offered in the new place. It was all like a dream to the brother: a new door was opened to him, he entered with a promotion and went in on a salary scale that had never existed in the company. That is what favour can do.
				</p>
				
				<p>
When God’s favour locates a man who had been stagnated, it moves him forward and upward very rapidly. That was Isaac’s story in Genesis 26:13. When God’s favour smiled on him, Isaac waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great. In verse 14 the Bible narrates the expansion of his wealth. He rose to the top among the wealthy people in Gerar such that he was envied by the nation. Saul, the son of Kish from the tribe of Benjamin, was another person that favour lifted up. He went out in search of his father’s lost asses. Unknown to him, favour was searching for him to put him on the throne. That favour took him straight to the top. In 1 Samuel 9:12-13, Saul was announced for the high place.				</p>
				
				<p>
Favour does not leave a man to crawl when it locates him. It terminates the struggles and pushes the man to the higher pedestal and where he will be celebrated. Rejoice in the Lord.				</p>
