            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Genesis 37:5-20 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: 1 Cor. 16:9</strong> <br>                         
For a great door and effectual 
is opened unto me, and there 
are many adversaries.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>The enemies of your vision can hinder the vision from being actualized on time. In the case of Joseph, the conspiracy of his brothers who envied him for his great vision, forced a setback of thirteen years on Joseph. The vision dragged on and on until the Lord’s intervention saw him through to the throne of his glory.<br /><br />
								Lofty visions always draw the attention of the enemies. Is it not surprising that it was Joseph’s brothers that rose up against the fulfillment of their brother’s vision? None of them could even think that the boy’s rising could be a benefit to them. In any case, the fact that the young man would become great would not stop the greatness of those brothers as well. Life is in stages and men are in sizes. If someone becomes great around you, there is no need for envy. Celebrate him and go to God and ask him to make you great also. There is an adage in West Africa which says the sky is enough for all birds to fly without one disturbing the others. John the Baptist was six months older than our Lord Jesus Christ. The angel that came to Zechariah while serving in the temple told him in Luke 1:15 that the son that would be born to him (that is John) <blockquote>‘shall be great.’</blockquote> Few months later, the angel that visited Mary to deliver the breaking news of the conception of our Lord Jesus Christ also told her that the child <blockquote>‘shall be great.’</blockquote> God knows how to sort every person out. He created all and He can bless all without the blessing of one disturbing the other. People who are jealous and envious are simply foolish and they lack understanding. The same God is over all and good to all. God will never consider your blessing before He blesses me.

				</p>
				
				<p>
				The best way to keep the enemies of your vision at bay is to walk closer with God. If God gives the vision, He has the power to bring it unto fulfillment. Joseph kept his cool and he never said a word when his brothers declared war against his vision. Unfortunately, every step they took pushed him nearer to the place where the vision would command global attention and celebration. It is doubtful whether Joseph’s glory would have shone as bright as it did in Egypt if he had stayed back in Canaan.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				You do not need to fight those who oppose your great vision physically. Joseph never did. When people fight a man God has put in a position, it would be foolish and naïve to fight them in the flesh. If you do that you will not allow God to deal with them. If you read Isaiah 54:15 you will discover that God is ready to scatter them if you permit Him. God rose for Joseph and enthroned him and his great vision was fulfilled and his brothers eventually bowed to him (Genesis 50:18). They declared with their own mouths that they were his servants. End of discussion. Rejoice in the Lord.
