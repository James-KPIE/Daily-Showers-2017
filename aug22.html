M.V: Acts 19:11 Many of them also
which used curious arts brought their
books together, and burned them before
all men: and they counted the price of
them, and found it fifty thousand 
pieces of silver.</code></pre>

				<p>Paul the apostle was not among the disciples in the upper room on the day of Pentecost. He was a late comer to the scene of Christianity. He was among those who supervised the killing of Stephen. Yet, the purpose of God was that he would become an apostle to be mightily used by God. In Acts chapter 9, he was on a mission to Damascus with his co-persecutors of the believers to unleash terror on those who believed in Christ when the Lord arrested him. He was the only one addressed by Jesus Christ
amidst his co-travelers. There and then he was struck with blindness and his process of transformation began. By the time he regained his sight, he was equally baptized in the Holy Spirit and right from then Paul entered into the ministry, trained for a while and God began to use him. We call him an overtaker because of the exploits he did by the power of the Holy Spirit.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Paul was mighty in the revelations which he caught by the Holy Spirit. His understanding of the subject of grace is amazing. He became a revolutionary of some sort because his teachings on grace were very powerful and caused confusion among those who believed in Jesus but who did not know that Jesus came with grace while He fulfilled the law. He challenged the Galatians that it was naive of them to begin in the spirit (under grace) and to end up labouring in the flesh (under law). There are people who are saved by grace but are struggling to please God by their own righteousness. That is a gross misunderstanding of all that Jesus Christ came to do for our salvation. The people under the dispensation of law were achievers, in that, they must produce their own personal righteousness to please God and qualify for His blessings. However, we are saved under grace as receivers because we are made righteous, not by our personal righteousness, but by the righteousness of Jesus which has been imputed unto us (Philippians 3:9). We must live holy to see Jesus and make heaven at last but our qualification for becoming children of God is the righteousness of Jesus Christ and that is our plea in all cases of intercession and supplication and warfare.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Apart from doing signs and wonder, Paul is also credited with writing about two third of the New Testament. That was more than any other author wrote in the New Testament. He came later and did much more. Rejoice in the Lord.
