            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: John 1:1-6 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: John 6:6</strong> <br>                         
And this he said to prove
him: for he himself knew
what he would do.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				In Philippians 4:19, Paul prophesied to the Philippian church that God would supply their needs according to His riches in glory. That prophecy was provoked by the sacrificial giving of the church to support
the apostle in ministry. In 2 Corinthians 8:5, Paul expressed how the
Macedonian church was able to minister to him because the brethren had first given themselves to the Lord. Christ’s mind is that our needs shall be supplied by God even as we cooperate with Him by taking instructions from Him. Simply put, obedience is the guarantee for our abundance.
<br /><br />
The meeting of our needs is about God’s abundance and not about our lack. That is what is meant when the Bible says in our memory verse that Jesus knew what He would do. The mind of Jesus does not see lack just as it does not see impossibility for with God nothing shall be impossible (Genesis 18:14, Job 42:2, Jeremiah 32:27; Jeremiah 32:17; Matthew 19:26 and Luke 1:37).
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The victory you desire is about God’s ability and not about your inability. That is why God tells us to keep our focus on Him and not on anything else (Hebrew 12:2). As far as Jesus Christ is concerned your victory is assured. The turnaround you yearn for is about God’s strength and not about your weakness. God told Gideon that much in Judges 6:15-16. The healing you need is about God’s divinity and not about your humanity. He can heal by His name, by His blood, by His deity, by His atonement, by His word and by the Holy Spirit. Your promotion is all about His sovereignty and not about your skill. Solomon was clear on that in Ecclesiastes 9:11 and the Psalmist told us so in Psalm 75:6.
				<br /><br />
				Your peace is all about His presence and not about your panting. No amount of your worrying will keep away trouble and danger. Jesus Christ said so in Matthew 6:27. Your spiritual standing (as you abide in holiness) is all about His righteousness and not about your goodness. Paul knew that much in Philippians 3:9. Your future rests squarely on His faithfulness and not on your philosophy because faithful is He who has promised who also will do it, according to 1 Thessalonians 5:24.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Brethren, our triumph is rooted in His truth. That is why we are on a search mission-the search through His word that we might find rest for our soul. Proverbs 24:14 says our prospects are bright when we make covenant discoveries. Search the mind of Christ on the issues of life and you shall not be stranded. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
