            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Psalm 50:7-12 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Hagg. 2:8</strong> <br>                         
The silver is mine, and
the gold is mine, saith
the LORD of hosts.</code></pre>

				<p>
				Kingdom addicts understand that they are accountable into the Lord for the use of their treasures. The reason, as we shared yesterday is that God is the Creator of all things and He is the only Adonai. The word
Adonai comes from the root word adon which means to own. Adonai means Lord, that is the One who owns and has control over all things. However, before the Lord can be lord over what you have he must be Lord over your life. The reason why people struggle to give is because they are obsessed with the mentality of ownership. If everything that comes into my hand belongs to God, then I can have no inhibition in releasing it for kingdom purposes. I don’t have the ultimate control over what I do not own but which I merely possess but God is the owner. He can direct the use and all I need do is submit unto Him. Some of us have operated under that principle for many years and we have resounding, undeniable testimonies.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				When you use the treasure in your hand for a kingdom purpose, you provoke God to touch what you are left with and when God touches anything it multiplies. For example, the Lord built a house for my family in 2014 all by His miraculous supplies. While I pondered on how we could be so highly favoured the Lord reminded me that nine years ago my family diverted tens of thousands of naira which we had wanted to use to buy shares in the stock market and used the money to change the leaking roof over the house of a widow. I then bowed in worship to the Adonai. As my elder brother’s wife would always say “God never forgets.” That is how sweet it can be to choose to be liberal because you understand that you are only a user of whatever comes into your hands but that God is the owner. That is one of the teachings of grace. When you operate at that level, you will then know that whatever project you embark upon will not depend on your own scarcity but on God’s abundance for its accomplishment. That in turn takes away anxiety and worry. <b>Kingdom mentality says that God and not any employer, person or institution is our source.</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Those who are addicted to the kingdom have such great joy in seeing what they can contribute to kingdom projects as a privilege. How do you feel when through your sponsorship an orphan becomes a university graduate and a degree holder? You can imagine my joy to know that, that widow and her children would no longer be soaked in water whenever it rained in the night. Those who are truly addicted to the kingdom derive joy from what good they can cause to happen to other people around them for the sake of the kingdom. Rejoice in the Lord.
