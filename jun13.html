            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Isa. 43:18</strong> <br>                         
Remember ye not the
former things,
neither consider the
things of old.</code></pre>

				We serve the unlimited God. There is no limit to what He can do. There is one vital factor which guarantees that we can experience the greatness of God in doing greater things in us and for us and
through us. This factor is a dimension of faith. Simply put, it is seeing as God sees through the eyes of faith. Unless we see with the eyes of faith we can never lay hold on the great promises of God in manifestation, neither can we maximize our faith in Christ.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				God wants us to see what He sees. In the build-up to Moses’ confrontation with Pharaoh, God ensured that Moses was well positioned supernaturally and even psychologically. Moses had lived in Pharaoh’s palace and enjoyed Pharaoh’s scholarship. He grew up in the palace and was well schooled in the wisdom of Egypt. In the natural order of things, may be another person whom Pharaoh had not related closely with would have been fit for the assignment. Recall that at a point, Moses even told God to send another person. I guess what was going on in Moses’ mind were those issues. Then God began to empower him. In Exodus 4:17, He empowered his rod. In Exodus 3:12, God had already assured Moses of divine presence in the task. However, thirdly in Exodus 7:1, God still went further and told Moses to see with the eyes of faith that He had made him as a god to Pharaoh. That was the climax of the preparation God made for Moses. As a god to Pharaoh, it means that whatever happened in the ensuing conflict, Moses’ word shall be the last over Pharaoh’s. And so it was. <b>God caused Moses to see victory before the fight.</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We can recall David’s declaration to Goliath in 1 Samuel 17:47. <b>David saw that he prevailed over Goliath through divine power before they fought.</b> It is those who see far that go far in life. Many people don’t see anything other than the natural around them. They allow newspaper reports, economic analysis and the like to shape what they see. We are children of God and we have the eyes of faith. David saw the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living through the eyes of faith and he gave the testimony in Psalm 27:3. He was confronted by all manners of adversaries in the city and in the desert but he saw a glorious future and he got there. We shall continue tomorrow. For now, what do you see?. Rejoice in the Lord.
