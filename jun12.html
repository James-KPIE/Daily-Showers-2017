            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Gen. 50:20</strong> <br>                         
But as for you, ye
thought evil against
me; but God meant it
unto good, to bring to
pass, as it is this
day, to save much
people alive.</code></pre>

				Most times, our opportunities lie in the womb of our difficulties. That is why God may not always answer all our prayers because He can see beyond what we can. Most Christians pray against adverse circumstances and trials. However, in every challenge, we must ask God what exactly He would have us to learn or to
do. David had been at the backside of the desert, forgotten by his father and unwanted by his half brothers. Bible history tells us that David was the only son that his mother bore for Jesse. The abandonment of David exposed him to many dangers but the Lord kept him. Unknown to him the fight with Goliath would be his path to stardom. Thank God he did not run away to avoid fighting Goliath. If he did, he would have missed a life time opportunity.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				King Saul left his father’s house as a messenger on an errand to seek for his father’s lost ass. Thank God he did not refuse to obey the instruction of his father. It was in the process of going about looking for the animal in the company of a servant that he met Prophet Samuel who anointed him as the first king of Israel. In the empire of Babylon, it was the ordeal of Daniel and the escape which the Lord gave him from the mouth of the lions that led to a proclamation by the king that everyone should serve the God of Daniel. In the New Testament, the persecution of the apostles and the consequent scattering of the early converts into other regions worked to the advantage of the spreading of the gospel. While we all pray that the Lord should halt the murderous monster in the middle-east, we can also pray that the millions of people who are flooding Europe as refugees would be met with the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. We should see this difficulty around that region of the world as a great opportunity.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The story of Joseph cannot be forgotten because it underscores how God can make difficulties give birth to great opportunities in our lives. Joseph endured those hard times and the devaluation of his personality when he suffered degradation as a slave and humiliation as a prisoner. However, as it is echoed in our memory verse for today, God used those trials not only for Joseph’s lifting but for a universal benefit in providing succour for many countries during a major famine period. Let us be calm in the face of challenges even as we pray that God will use them, ultimately, for our advantage and for the blessing of other people. Rejoice in the Lord.
