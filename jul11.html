            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Isaiah 12:1-3 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Ps. 51:12</strong> <br>                         
Restore unto me the joy of 
thy salvation; and uphold 
me with thy free spirit.</code></pre>

				There is no greater joy than the joy of salvation. The greatest thing that can happen in a man’s life is for him to be reconciled to his Maker and that is what salvation achieves. A saved soul is victorious over sin as the dominion of sin over him is broken.
(Romans 6:14). Redemption creates a new nature in us, a nature that carries the image of the holy God. <blockquote>The essence of salvation is Christlikeness.</blockquote> When we become like Him, we can relate with Him and He can abide with us. This is the position that guarantees blessing, favour and victory.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				David valued the joy of salvation and so should we. Salvation helps you to surrender your life to Christ so that God can be your Ally and when God is with you, your battles will be won because you will no longer fight with your strength alone. David went through the agony of abandonment very early in his life. He was left alone in the desert and was almost completely forgotten by his father. His half brothers were also very unfriendly. So, he could only find succour in God. As he found God, he began to enjoy the unspeakable joy of salvation as his heart panted after God. As he had different encounters with God, he was inspired once and again and he grew in his understanding of the revelation of God. His confidence in God also increased. That was why David could confidently declare: “The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.” All that was made possible by the joy of salvation.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				As we seek the Lord daily, we find the joy of salvation in His presence according to Psalm 16:11. Even in our dark hours, our soul will still rejoice in God’s faithfulness because we have the joy of salvation. The joy of salvation comes from within us and not from outside. It flows from God to our heart and it fuels us. <b>Happiness may be a function of the things that happen around us but joy comes from the presence of the Lord.</b> That is why the psalmist said that in the presence of the Lord is joy evermore. The more room we create for God in our heart, the greater the joy that we have. We must therefore, be careful to avoid the drainers of joy. The number one drainer of joy is sin. Whenever a true child of God sins, he loses the joy of salvation. The pursuit of vanity can also drain our joy just as unequal yoking with unbelievers can also diminish our joy. Be watchful so your joy shall not deplete. Rejoice in the Lord.
