And Abram was very rich

and in gold.</code></pre>

				Abraham’s fifteenth covenant credential was hard work. The elders have a saying that “Hard work is the cure for hard life.” It is only hard workers that are entitled to high life. In other words,
high life is the heritage of hard workers. The Lord will only back up the diligent and that is the commitment of God. The Almighty God has no delight in lazy fellows. That is why God does not call the lazy ones into kingdom assignment. If you find lazy ministers in God’s vineyard, they probably called themselves into what they are doing. Our Lord Jesus Christ sought for His disciples amongst busy tax collectors and fishermen. Elisha was a highly successful farmer who employed twelve harvesters to handle harvest in his very large farms. It was a lot of struggle for some of us to turn our back to a flourishing law practice when the weight of ministry work was becoming very heavy. God loves hard workers.<br /><br />
Abraham, our father of faith was very industrious. When God called him, he got inspired into a diligent life. He ventured into agriculture business, and specialized in cattle rearing. He engaged in mining for the exploration of gold and silver. In Genesis 13:2, the Bible reports that he was rich in gold and silver and in cattle. Abraham was so rich from his multiple streams of income that he used to carry money everywhere he went. His servants included, as it were, accountants, financial managers and treasurers. When he wanted to buy a piece of land from the people of Hebron in Genesis 23:1-6, they refused to sell land to him because he had been of great blessing to them. However, Abraham insisted that he would pay for the land. There and then he weighed the current price of the land in shekel and paid to the land owners. It was four hundred shekels of silver. Abraham was rich because he worked hard.<br /><br />
Another attitude of high riders which Abraham demonstrated was that they are early risers. Abraham always rose up very early, even when he wanted to go and sacrifice Isaac on mount Moriah. Do you desire a high life? Then work hard and be an early riser. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
