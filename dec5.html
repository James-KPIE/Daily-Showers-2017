            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: 2 Cor. 8:2</strong> <br>                         
How that in great trial
of affliction the
abundance of their joy
and their deep poverty
abounded unto the
riches of their liberality.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				Paul was impressed by the liberality of the Macedonian churches. They gave what has been called violent offering. It is an offering which you give and your pocket feels it. It is such an offering which you give without considering what you have left. An offering of this nature comes
from those who are addicted to the kingdom. They only consider what is
necessary for the kingdom per time and that is what motivates their giving. Unlike such people, we have many Christians who are calculating givers. They give only when their giving is arithmetically balanced. They give only when it is convenient. In the kingdom equation, convenience is the greatest enemy of commitment. If you are waiting for convenience, you will never save money and you will find it difficult to sow your seed of increase.
<br /><br />
<b>Giving is living.</b> Whoever will hold unto what he already has will never create room for more. A person who refuses to let go the waste from what he has eaten will soon die. The Dead Sea is so called because it does not flow out. I was at the Dead Sea in 2007 and it was already drying up. Reputed as the lowest sea level on the earth, I do not know what state it will be now. Like the Dead Sea, a person who is withholding more than he requires is signing up for poverty according to Proverbs11:24. However, the liberal souls like the brethren in the Macedonia churches will be made fat (verse 25).
				</p>
				
				<p>
				God is always touched with our sacrificial giving. Many of us have experienced the wonders of God in this area time after time. It is same story for the church as a corporate personality. Most recently we raised a seed of N50,000 naira and sowed it from our church building fund. What we had in the account at that time was very meagre compared to the cost of the building project we were currently handling. We sowed that seed into another church which is presently building a sanctuary that is gulping hundreds of millions of naira. Shortly thereafter a guest minister came to our church, saw the project and decided to support it with N1,000,000 (one million) naira. We don’t solicit for funds, we do no fund raising for projects, but we do sow our seed and expect a harvest from God who has always proved Himself as Jehovah Jireh, the Possessor of heaven and earth.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Children of the kingdom must walk the kingdom walk, speak the kingdom language, think as kingdom citizens and give as the King of our kingdom does. God had only One begotten Son and He gave Him sacrificially. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
