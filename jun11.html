            <h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>
            <h4 align="right">Sun. June 11, 2017</h4>
            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Eph. 6:1-4 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Ps. 127:3</strong> <br>                         
Lo, children are an
heritage of the
LORD: and the fruit
of the womb is his
reward.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				Today is Children’s Day in some parts of the world. It is a day in which attention shall be given to issues that touch on children. Our focus in this devotional this day shall be on the abuse of children. In weeks preceding the writing of the exhortation for today, a case of
underage marriage of a sixteen year old girl became a national issue in Nigeria. The young girl had been lured away from her home in the South-Eastern part of the country to the Northern part of the country and was put into a forced marriage. She was recently restored back to her family but not before she had been abused by her abductor. This is one of numerous cases of child abuse in many parts of the world. Unfortunately, in many under-developed nations ravaged by poverty, the governments of such countries do not even have any reliable data upon which budgetary provisions could be based for the welfare of children. In most places, the children are exposed to all manners of vices right from early childhood.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Parents and governments owe it a responsibility to God to nurture children and give them quality lives. Parents, in particular, should refrain from uncontrolled child-bearing when they know that they lack the economic capacity to take care of these children. Our children are a reward from God and the best way to appreciate God for giving us children is to train them and take care of them. Children should also be exposed to the doctrines of the Bible very early. It will build a strong foundation for their adult age. Children who fear God from early childhood will be morally empowered to navigate the tempestuous waters of decadence that has flooded our world. I have posited that the home rather than the school is the place where a proper foundation should be laid for children. Parents should <b>train</b> their children because teachers are only to <b>teach</b> them. You train children to ingrain or impact principles for living whereas teachers teach them to acquire skills for their future engagements. If parents do not train their children morally at home, their character may not be built at school.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				I want to challenge well-to-do individuals in our various communities to reach out to brilliant but financially incapacitated children to provide education for them through the granting of scholarships. If this can be done, many lives could be rescued from waste and the society will be the better for it. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
