            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Psalm 62:11</strong> <br>                         
God hath spoken
once; twice have I
heard this; that
power belongeth
unto God.</code></pre>

				God may be silent because He is not talkative. He is patient with us when we engage Him in a long conversation such as that between Himself and Abraham during his intercession for Sodom in Genesis 18:16-33, or His long discussion with Moses when he was
called upon to go to Egypt for the deliverance of Israel from the house of slavery (Exodus 3 and 4). However, once God has spoken, the matter is put to rest because He will never go forward and backward on an issue as man could do. So, if you try to put words in His mouth in order to prolong a matter, God may choose to remain quiet. After God had passed His judgment on Moses for failing to honour Him before Israel in Numbers 20, Moses subsequently made efforts to plead with God to relax the punishment that he would not enter into the Promised Land. At a point God warned Moses not to raise the issue again.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				God may keep quiet because He does not need to talk much to accomplish His purpose. For example His word simply says to tell the righteous that it shall be well with Him (Isaiah 3:10). The righteous is the person who fears God and walks according to the ways of God. God’s way is the highway of holiness (Isaiah 35:8). However, as simple as that conclusion is, many people, even Christians want to hear more. They go to pastors and ask what they see concerning them. I tell such people that I see that it shall be well with them, if they are righteous. A lady came to me for prayers many prayers ago because she wanted to travel abroad. Upon enquiry I found out that she wanted to go abroad with a forged passport, using someone else’s identity. I told her I would not pray because the Lord would not go with her on the journey. She left, disappointed. Why do we want God to change what He has already said? God does not owe us any explanation for keeping quiet once He has spoken.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The Psalmist said that God had spoken once but twice he heard Him. Why? This is because whenever God speaks once, the whole creation will echo it. That is why God’s word is constant and the same in every tribe and language. There are people who want to manipulate the word for their own evil ways but the truth of His word is unchanging from generation to generation. God reserves the right to be silent once He has spoken. It is our responsibility to hear what He has said. Rejoice in the Lord.
