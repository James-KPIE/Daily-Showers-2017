            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Jer. 17:5</strong> <br>                         

Thus saith the LORD; Cursed 
be the man that trusteth 
in man, and maketh flesh his 
arm, and whose heart 
departeth from the LORD.</code></pre>

				<p>
				No man can take God’s place in your life. And if any mortal man tells you that without him you cannot be, look straight into his eyes and tell him that he is a liar. God does not want us to make any man our God. Only God can be God over our lives. There are men and women who want to be deified because they have some political and economic advantages over and above other people
around them. Such people want to earn human worship. Whoever you worship besides God has become your idol. God hates every form of idolatry.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The Bible says that the fear of man brings a snare. You cannot fear God and fear men. If God is indeed your Source and your Help, if He is your Father by adoption and you know it, you will find it difficult to make man your god. The reason why Meshac, Shadrach and Abednego defied the law of the king and preferred instead to go into the fiery furnace to die was because they knew their God (Daniel 11:32). If you truly know God, you can be rude to the devil. Daniel knew God and he refused the order that banned him from praying to Jehovah. He preferred to be fed to the lions rather than please man and displease God. In Acts chapter 5, Peter and the other disciples told their persecutors that they would rather obey God and dare the consequences, than give in to the threats of those enemies of the gospel. In all those cases, God took over. The fire of the fiery furnace had no power over the Hebrew boys and the lions could not feast upon Daniel because God shut their mouths. The gospel spread unto other towns and villages as a result of the resistance of the apostles even though they were persecuted. They endured hardship in their choice not to idolize mortal men.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Abraham told the king of Salem in Genesis 14, that he would not take the spoil of war so that no man would claim to have made Abraham rich. Abraham knew God and God became his Source. David also knew God and he made declarations to the effect that he trusted in God only as his Source. You cannot afford to idolize any man or woman. If God places a curse upon the man that trusts in another man, how much more would God deal with a man who makes another man his object of worship. No man is entitled to earn your worship. You cannot afford to lift your eyes up to any man. Focus on God, who alone has the power to meet all your needs. Rejoice in the Lord.
