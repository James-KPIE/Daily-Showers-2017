				Apart from uncommon influence and supernatural favour, the blessing of Abraham also finds expression in supernatural victory. Such victory does not come because a person is skilled in martial arts or by the potency of the weapons in his arsenal. On the contrary, we have seen such victories wherein ordinary singers overcame soldiers who were armed to the teeth as in 2
Chronicles 20:20-25 or as in the case where the unarmed children of Israel sang in triumph over Pharaoh and his chariots at the Red Sea according to Exodus 14:13-30 or as in the case where only one angel killed 185,000 Assyrian soldiers who had laid siege to Israel in Isaiah 37:36. We all know that David’s sling was not comparable to all the weapons that Goliath had amassed against David in the epic battle by proxy between the Philistines who were well armed and the hapless, fearful and overwhelmed Israelites. In all these cases, it was the unseen hands of the Lord of host which gave victory to His people. Glory be to God.<br /><br />
Supernatural victory is our heritage in Christ because it is part of our covenant blessing in Abraham. The father of faith (not known so much as a soldier) had led a battle against a multinational army that overran Sodom and carried the inhabitants away as captives, including Lot, Abraham’s nephew. How did a cattle rearer and gold–miner rattle a multinational army with a hurriedly assembled army which was made up of Abraham’s second generation servants? Their victory was divine. Our supernatural victory as a blessing which we inherited in Abraham by covenant has been preserved for us through Jesus Christ. That is why the Bible has given us a covenant title known as ‘more than conquerors’ in Romans 8:37. We are more than conquerors because in the spiritual battles we engage in, the Almighty God undertakes for us, fight the battles and gives us the victory. All we need do is to provoke our victory by faith (1 John 5:4).<br /><br />
Are you facing any kind of battle in any front? Turn to the Lord of hosts–meditate on the victories which the Lord had given to His covenant children and stand on God’s testimonies by faith. You shall soon overcome. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
