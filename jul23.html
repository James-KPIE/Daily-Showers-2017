            <h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>
            <h4 align="right">Sun. July 23, 2017</h4>
            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Ecclesiastes 11:1-6 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Ecc. 11:3</strong> <br>                         
If the clouds be full of 
rain, they empty themselves 
upon the earth: and if the 
tree fall toward the south, 
or toward the north, in 
the place where the tree 
falleth, there it shall be.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				The power of the seed is tremendous. The Lord ordained it to be so since He created Adam. Indeed, before Adam was created the Lord had put the seed principle in place in Genesis 1:11 that every tree will produce after its kind. That verse of scripture mentions <b>the seed, the fruit and the tree.</b> If you desire the fruit, sow the seed; if you want the tree, nurture the fruit. The future of every tree is in its seed. God never created
another man the way He created Adam because He used the seed principle. He created Adam and put inside Adam the seed from which the billions of people on the earth today have been produced. It is an amazement.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Why does the scripture encourage us to sow our seed continuously? It is sure that one of such seeds will become your breakthrough seed. <b>The law of harvest prevents you from knowing which one! That is reserved for the Lord of the harvest.</b> The same principle applies to the sperm which a man deposits in his wife to fertilize the egg. The sperm count is in millions but only one is required to fertilize the egg. Can you, the husband and father, determine which one? Absolutely impossible.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				I remember a great man of God whose ministry is one of the biggest and the most successful in the West African coast. He said he knows that he is born again and those of us who are familiar with him can bear witness to that. He also said he did not know the precise day he got born again because he answered altar calls for salvation about twenty times but that, at least, on one of such occasions the Lord saved him. The tender heart of a newly converted Christian is like that. Each time you hear a compelling and inspiring message, you want to respond.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Like that man of God, keep sowing your seed in obedience to scripture. Don’t relent. Don’t complain. Don’t murmur. Murmuring will kill your seed and will not let it grow. After you sow your seed, do what Abraham did according to Romans 4:19-20. We must know that the Lord of harvest is faithful in His commitment to fulfill His own side of the bargain. It must also be understood that we must not sow the seed grudgingly in the first place. The state of our heart and our faith are very important at the period between the sowing and the harvest. Rejoice in the Lord.
