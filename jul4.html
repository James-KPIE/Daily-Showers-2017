            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: 1 Samuel 2:3-8 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Ps. 115:3</strong> <br>                         
But our God is in the 
heavens: he hath done 
whatsoever he hath 
pleased.</code></pre>

				We ended yesterday’s sermon with the fact about divine sovereignty. It is in God’s power to do as He pleases and no one can query Him. In His sovereignty, He may choose to keep quiet over an issue. He is the Almighty God and there is no limit to His power. Ecclesiastes 8:4 says the power of the king is where he
is and no one can ask him why he does the things he does. When God keeps silent, we can only ask for a word from Him as we plead for His mercy. Even then, He owes us no explanation. No one can challenge Him when He keeps silent. When Jesus Christ asked His Father why He forsook Him (as we explained recently) the Father uttered no word in return. Our conclusion was that since it was the will of the Father for Jesus to go through that, so that we may be saved, it was in the interest of mankind for the Father to be silent, so that the plan of salvation may not be jeopardized.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The sovereignty of God is a very difficult subject for many Christians. Even when we go to ask God why, we may be wrong in asking so. A reading through Jeremiah 18:4-6 will show us how God demonstrates His supremacy. He says that as a potter He can do whatever He wants with the clay. He says that as the clay is in the potter’s hand, so are we in His hand.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Perhaps, some of us who write books have even made suggestions which do not accurately explain God’s mind over the issues on which He was silent, down the centuries. For example, the Lord hated Esau and loved Jacob. What was Esau’s sin? Did he cheat or supplant? May be if God were to give us an explanation on every subject, we may become rude and behave as if He is our equal. When the Lord permitted Judah to take over the number one place ahead of Levi, Simeon and Reuben, their father pointed to Reuben’s immorality. Was Judah less immoral? Was he not the first man to patronize a prostitute? Was it that Jacob didn’t know? Reuben’s immorality was in the bedroom while that of Judah was made public at the town square! So their father would have known. And that is where divine sovereignty comes in.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Wisdom demands that we submit to the sovereignty of God when He is silent. As pastors and preachers, we must not be under any pressure to suggest that God said something when He has said nothing. That is why God is God and every man of God is still a man. Rejoice in the Lord.
