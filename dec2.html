            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Phili. 1:21</strong> <br>                         
For to me to live is
Christ, and to die
is gain.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				Kingdom addiction is all about following Jesus Christ all the way without compromise co me what may. It is to remain unwaivering in our commitment to the kingdom and to be steadfast in the faith even if we
need to lose our lives in that pursuit. Those who have truly found life in the kingdom of God will not like to lose it for any reason. And that is where addiction comes in. Addiction binds you to a practice or a taste which will require a serious crisis within you to let go. That was the posture of the disciples in the Acts of the Apostles. They refused to deny Jesus at the peril of their lives. They were jailed. Some of them like Stephen and James the brother of John had been killed by the sword. Peter was next on target after James was killed and he was ready to die but God saved his life so he might proclaim the kingdom agenda for a longer time.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Kingdom addiction is a ‘committal’ in a sense. That word is relevant as it is the expression used for a dead person who is buried and everyone knows that he will never be seen again as a human person. The addicted believer is also dead in a sense that his life has been surrendered to Jesus as a living sacrifice. He is still breathing but he has died to sin and to the flesh. His life is now hidden in God by Christ Jesus and he lives by the righteousness of Christ and no longer by his own righteousness (Philippians 3:9). He stands for Christ and the word of God. He may be rich or poor but he is satisfied with Jesus. He did not reckon success by the world’s definition of success. Rather, he measures success by the fulfillment of his life’s purpose in Christ. The addicted believer’s greatest ambition is to live to please God and to do His will to the end.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				It has become necessary to paint this true picture of kingdom life because it appears to me that the fervor and unreserved commitment to the cause of the kingdom is disappearing very fast among Christians. We have mostly people who are mere followers of Christ today as opposed to disciples and they are in no way addicted to the kingdom. They are casual in their Christian walk and they are committed to nothing. Christianity is not an adjustment of a lifestyle but a radical departure from the life of sin and godlessness. The sad thing is that the wind of the end time can easily blow you away if you are not a kingdom addict. My take is that every casual Christian may end up as a casualty. May that not be your portion. Wake up unto kingdom addiction. Rejoice in the Lord.
