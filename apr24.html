And the flocks conceived

					Ideas rule the world this is very true. Behind every advancement in human affairs, is an idea. Innovations are the products of the creative mind which God has graciously endowed man with. Without new ideas, this world would have remained in the ‘yesterday’ and we would have remained in the primitive era. Thank
God for giving us the seed of creativity so that through the Spirit of
God, we can function as co-creators with Him.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The story of Jacob shows us how one idea can change everything. Here was a man whose fortunes were waning, who was laboring more and earning less and whose advancement in age and in domestic responsibilities could not be matched with his income. Contrary to the word of God which says that there is profit in all labour, Jacob’s input was increasing, yet Laban was reviewing his compensation downwards. Then he cried to the Lord in verse 30. He also pleaded his righteousness in verse 33. He used those two spiritual weapons – prayer and righteousness to make way for himself. In Psalm 57:2, the Psalmist said: “I will cry to the Lord for it is God who performs all things for me.” Jacob pleaded his righteousness and heaven responded favourably to him by sending a strange idea to him. Today, as born again children of God, we can plead the righteousness of Jesus Christ which has been imputed to us and that is what we do when we cry to God for mercy in the name of Jesus. Each time we pray in the name of Jesus we are pleading His righteousness. If we meet other conditions such as right motive, a clean heart and faith in God, we receive answers to our prayers.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The uncommon idea which Jacob used caused the type of cattle which Laban agreed to be the reward for Jacob’s labour to increase rapidly as the cattle reproduced. Very soon, the labourer overtook his employer in wealth. That was a major wealth transfer in the Bible and it came through just one idea. Are you stagnated where you are today? Ask God for an idea that would change your story and move you forward. Rejoice in the Lord.
