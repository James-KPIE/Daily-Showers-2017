            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Is. 40:31</strong> <br>                         

But they that wait upon 
the LORD shall renew their 
strength; they shall mount 
up with wings as eagles; 
they shall run, and not be 
weary; and they shall walk, 
and not faint.</code></pre>

				<p>
				As we develop our spiritual muscles and deepen our consecration and commitment to God, we enter into the spiritual experience which is described in our Bible reading for today. That is the stage where the Holy Spirit becomes our carrier, when we mount with eagle’s wings. It is a state where we are fully surrendered to God through complete obedience and the Almighty God finds us submissive enough to be instructed and to follow instructions. As I reflected on the exhortation
on the crawlers two days ago, this generation is witnessing the emergence of many self–willed believers and this posture is affecting so many things in my own understanding. Just as the Spirit of God will not strive with us (Genesis 6:3) the expression of God’s power in every Christian’s life is a function of his yieldedness, holiness and obedience. People struggle nowadays to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit. It was not as difficult in those days. The consecration that we find around today is very superficial to say the least and this may be the reason why the manifestation of the Holy Spirit is curtailed.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The plan of God for us is to be at the cruising level. When we fly in the plane (which is the fastest level of movement), we cruise at the highest level. Now, we find ourselves at such altitudes without an effort of our own. We are seated in the aircraft and we may be eating or sleeping. No matter what we are doing, our cruising height is determined by the aircraft’s cruising altitude. That is how the Holy Spirit wants to carry us on. To mount on eagle’s wings means to be empowered, energized and enabled by the power of the Most High. From our spiritual experiences, how much energy has any of us exerted in order to raise the dead or for the healing of a sick fellow or to make the barren fruitful? Most times we pray a simple prayer; God honours the prayer and does a miracle just to glorify His name. It is His doing but by His sovereignty and the efficacy of grace, God uses ordinary mortals like us to instigate miracles according to His power in us. That is why it is great wisdom to live holy, submissive and obedient lives as the children of the Almighty God so He may use us.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				I have witnessed diverse miracles in the course of ministry. To be candid, I wonder at the Lord’s doing just as the recipients of the miracles also wonder. The secret of cruising in the Spirit is to be submerged in His river. We shall continue tomorrow. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
