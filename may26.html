            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Ex. 34:30</strong> <br>                         

And when Aaron and all 
the children of Israel 
saw Moses, behold, 
the skin of his face 
shone; and they were 
afraid to come nigh him.</code></pre>

				It has been observed that those who take time to be in the presence of God constantly in true spiritual worship, usually obtain a “rubbing off” of divine presence that makes them look radiant and different in their countenance. This was true of Moses when he was with God on the mountain for forty days and forty nights in fasting and prayer. Moses went up to
Mount Sinai on many occasions to seek the face of God in spiritual worship and to receive the commandments of the Lord for His people Israel. In the passage which we read for devotion today, Moses returned from the mountain and there was a glow on his face so radiant that the people could not behold his face. He was covered by the glory of God which he returned with from the mountain where he had spent time alone with God
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We are created to look like God because we are made in His image and formed in His likeness. To look like God means to exhibit His character in such a way that other people will know that we are of God without having to tell them. When the people of Antioch observed the lives of the early Christians, they came to the conclusion that they were Christ–like hence they began to call them Christians (Acts 11:26).
				</p>
				
				<p>
				True worship shapes our character and makes us to become more and more like God. The more you pay a visit to God in the secret place, the more His nature reflects through you. For example, if you have been to the hallowed place of worship, you will be overwhelmed by His mercy. You will appreciate His loving kindness and how He has forgiven our iniquities. That reality will help you to show kindness to other people and cause you to be willing to forgive those who offend you. When the virtues of Godliness become a revelation to you from the place of worship, you cannot but order your life in the same direction. The truth is that whatever you ‘see’ in His uncommon presence and apply same to yourself, it stays with you. Many Christians who are gentle today were once the opposite but as they tarried in the Lord’s presence through worship, they became shaped in the gentleness of the Lamb. Deep and consistent worship makes us to be more and more like God. Rejoice in the Lord.
