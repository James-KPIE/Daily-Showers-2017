            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Acts 4:24-33 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Acts 4:31</strong> <br>                         
And when they had
prayed, the place was
shaken where they
were assembled
together; and they
were all filled with
the Holy Ghost, and
they spake the word
of God with boldness.</code></pre>

				<p>
				Prayer must precede our evangelistic efforts. Prayer provokes the release of power for exploits in the kingdom. Prayer also brings the fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit. The disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit once and again after they prayed. The Holy Spirit is our senior partner in the business of soul-winning. It is very important to have the assurance that the Holy Spirit is with us in all that we do because He is our enabler and the One who convicts souls of sin and moves the hearts of men to repentance.
Our intellectual power or logical presentation of the gospel cannot achieve that for the kingdom. However, but for prayers, the disciples would not have achieved all that they did and that we are still doing as exploits in the kingdom.
<br /><br />
One key area in which prayers helped the disciples was that the Holy Spirit gave them the much needed boldness for the task of evangelism. They were being persecuted, beaten and jailed. The enemies even laid hands on some of the apostles and killed them. For example, they killed Stephen in Acts 7 and in Acts 12, they also killed James the brother of John. If it were not for the quick intercession of the brethren, Peter would have been killed too. He was delivered from the prison the night before he was to be murdered. The killing was quite demoralizing and such occurrences could send fear into the hearts of the other disciples. Through prayers they were strengthened and emboldened to keep on the task of evangelism.

				<p>
				We must remember to pray for all our brethren in places like Iraq, Syria and Pakistan and all over the world who are facing the greatest threat to their faith. A few days before I wrote this exhortation, the blood-thirsty demons called terrorists had just unleashed terror on peace loving Christians who were celebrating Easter in Pakistan. There seems to be no end to their orgies of violence. It is the same story in Paris, France and in Brussels in Belgium. May the Lord strengthen the resolve of all true believers in those areas to hold unto their faith in Jesus to the very end. If there is a way our encouragement could get to them apart from our prayers, we should not hesitate to reach out to them.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We must remain faithful to praying daily not only that the souls of these wicked fellows shall be saved, we should also pray for ourselves to be able to carry on this task to the end of this world. Rejoice in the Lord.
