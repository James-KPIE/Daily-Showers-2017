            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Matt. 19:1-9 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Gen. 2:24</strong> <br>                         
Therefore shall a man
leave his father and his
mother, and shall
cleave unto his wife: 
and they shall be one flesh.</code></pre>

				Jesus Christ is the husband of the church. Paul gave this analogy in Ephesians 5:23-27. Christ is also the head of the church for which He paid the supreme price of laying down His life so that His blood can cleanse a people who shall be redeemed to constitute His church – the
body of Christ. Husbands are to love their wives as Jesus loves the church.
<br /><br />
<b>The mind of Christ sees marriage as union between a man and a woman and not between a man and another man or between a woman and another woman.</b> There is no justification for the perversion that we see all around now, from Genesis to Revelation. So, if you find yourself in any kind of sin such as immorality, drinking, smoking, hate, murder or corruption of any kind or having affection towards a person of the same sex, all these are condemned in the Bible because God disapproves of them. Every sin is the same in the eyes of God. No one of them can be justified. Many of us who are serving God today were deep in immorality before Jesus saved us and took the taste for alcohol and immorality away. Anyone whose mind is drawn into any act which the word of God disapproves has only one way to go – the way of repentance. <b>There is no legislation that can re-write the word of God.</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Sometime last year, North Carolina made a law that should not offend anyone but the outcry of anger against the law has been alarming. The law simply stipulates that people with male organ should use the male toilet in public places while the people with female organ should use the female toilet. The law was met with criticism in many quarters. We are just beginning to see the confusion which the world will go through when men disconnect from God and will not unlearn those things which their souls have learnt in perversion. Very soon, America will become a genderless society where it will be an offence to ask anyone to indicate for official purposes whether he or she is a male or a female. Sin fascinates before it assassinates. When men legalize what God outlaws, the end can only be destruction. The Almighty God is still on His throne and He rules in the affairs of men.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Paul the apostle quoted Genesis 2:24 again in Hebrew 5:31 to confirm the unity of inspiration of both the Old Testament and the New. It is insane to call good what God calls evil. God will never adjust His word to suit our lustful passion. If you have been drawn to the side of Satan, turn to Jesus today. Rejoice in the Lord.
