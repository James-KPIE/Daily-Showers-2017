            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Matt. 25:31-46</h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Rev. 22:12</strong> <br>                         
And, behold, I come
quickly; and my reward
is with me, to give every
man according as his
work shall be.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				Matthew 25 has three parables which our Lord Jesus Christ told us to help us prepare for the reward that await us in heaven. And the three parables have to do with works. Anywhere you see reward being mentioned in life’s affairs, there is an undertone of works. Among the ten virgins to whom the dwellers of the kingdom are likened are the wise and
the foolish ones. The wise ones gave themselves to work to get oil in their lamps and they further ensured that the oil was sufficient in their lamps. It requires work to stay alert to monitor the rate at which their lamps were consuming the oil. It is work, brethren, to stay awake in the hours of the night to pray.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				There is no kingdom reward without kingdom work. We considered that in some details yesterday. Citizens of the kingdom are addicted to work. We call them work-addicts. Who will you resemble if you are indolent? Definitely not Jesus Christ. He said in John 5:17 <blockquote>“My Father has been working until now; and I have been working.”</blockquote> It is insane to look forward to rewards when a man has dodged working. The second parable of the talents is also about work. You see, we need to emphasize work more than rewards especially if we are mature Christians. Rewards are automatic if you work. If you give yourself to work you may even be surprise to be given rewards which you never knew of its existence and it does not matter. Some of the servants went to work with the talents and made profit with them whereas one was only wise in complaining because he was lazy. The indolent will always find excuses. However, on the last day explanations will not avail.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The third parable is that of those who neglect the labour of love versus those who gave their times for the practice. There are Christians who live unto themselves alone. They heap up wealth for themselves alone and are happy doing that because they have ‘sweated’ for their money. So they ignore the poor, the prisoner, the sick, the widow and the orphan. I was shocked when I read this passage with understanding for the first time because I had believed that one will make heaven once you live holy even if you ignore the works of love. However, our Master says no. He says if we have His own kind of heart of compassion we will minister to the needy as well. So much to learn about the qualifications for kingdom rewards. Are we learning?. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
