            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Esther 6:1-3 </h3>
            <pre><code>M.V: Acts 9:39<b style="color:red"></b> <br>                         
Then Peter arose and
went with them.
When he was come,
they brought him
into the upper
chamber: and all the
widows stood by him
weeping, and
shewing the coats
and garments which
Dorcas made, while
she was with them.</code></pre>Whatever good deed God does not forget, He can cause people to remember on your account. On the other hand, whatever good gesture which people can remember that you have done may become the subject of their petition and intercession for you in the day of your trouble or challenge. We can see how God can use a past unrewarded act to save the day for the person who might have forgotten all about what he did, as in the case of Mordecai. Our God is the all-knowing God. Haman had perfected his wicked plans to hang Mordecai in the<br>gallows. Mordecai did not know about it. The king was not aware of the game that was up the sleeves of Haman either. However, in a drama that only God could play out, He caused the king to be sleepless and to remember Mordecai’s unrewarded act of patriotism at the time it was most needed. The coincidence was purely divine. The rest is history. Haman suffered humiliation first and later he died in the gallows which he had prepared to hang Mordecai.<br><br>The case of Lady Dorcas is striking. It also shows us that God does not forget. People do not forget either. You may not know how far your good acts can be noticed. You may not also know who can be used to bring a reward your way and what kind of reward your deeds may fetch. That is why you must always lay down your seed like the boy who gave his lunch to Jesus, to feed thousands of people and got away from the scene. We cannot dictate to God what He should do or how to reward our deeds which we are enabled to do by grace. It is up to God to do that which He deems fit. <br><br>When Peter came in to pray for Dorcas who had died, the scripture says people were showing the garments which Dorcas had made for them. Dorcas was a generous woman. She made people to have a feel of what she could give through her skill in dress-making. It is through your own area of gifting that you can express the liberality of your soul. Our Lord Jesus has told us that our Father in heaven will reward our deeds which are done in the secret. We must pray that such acts are the ones that attract commendation from the Lord. Rejoice in the Lord.<br><br><div
