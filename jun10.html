            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Heb. 3:6</strong> <br>                         
But Christ as a son
over his own house;
whose house are
we, if we hold
fast the confidence
and the rejoicing of
the hope firm unto
the end</code></pre>

				God has a master plan for our lives and He desires to build us according to His own pattern. We can never fulfill God’s purpose except we are built according to His original plan for our lives. Anyone who refuses to be built according to divine plan, risks ending up as a disappointment in destiny. We shall consider certain persons who ended that way in the Bible
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The original plan for Adam and Eve was that they would abide in God’s image of holiness and in the likeness of His purity. However, they missed all that in the Garden of Eden because of sin. Spirituality was lost in the garden and the couple could not continue to walk in the supernatural. Cain was created to love his brother and not hurt him. He defied God’s warning and went ahead to kill his innocent brother in anger without any justification. He ended up a vagabond. The plan of God for Reuben was to lead the twelve tribes of Israel but he jettisoned the plan through immorality and lost the number one position and the heritage of the first born. Dinah was the daughter of Jacob. God’s plan for her was to shine as a queen but she broke camp one day to go and see how the world was at Shechem. She never returned pure because she was defiled and that was the last time we heard of her in the Bible. It is a big risk not to live our lives according to God’s plan.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Samson was anointed from the womb and he needed not to pray for power before it flowed into him and through him. Yet he lost out because he violated God’s laws and lived carelessly. Gehazi would have inherited such great anointing in multiple dimensions of the anointing that was upon his master Elisha. He could not persevere as his master did. He was distracted from God’s plans for his life by his attraction to ephemeral things of this world and he lost the ministry which had such great potentials for his future. Judas lost out from being immortalized as one of the twelve apostles because he could not resist the temptation to betray his Master.
			<br /><br/ >
			We need to ask ourselves this vital question daily – Is my life being built according to God’s plans? The plans of God for our lives are expressly stated all over the Bible – to live to please God and obey His commands. Then, He will bring His great plans to fulfillment in our lives. Rejoice in the Lord.
