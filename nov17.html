But ye shall receive power, 
after that the Holy Ghost 
is come upon you: and ye 
shall be witnesses unto me 
both in Jerusalem, and in 
all Judaea, and in Samaria, 
and unto the uttermost part 
of the earth.</code></pre>

				<p>
				Jesus Christ is our Baptizer with the Holy Spirit. In John 20:21-22, our Lord Jesus personally ministered the Holy Spirit power to His disciples to empower them for the service in the kingdom. Only ten of the disciples were available for the exercise because Judas had departed and Thomas the doubter was still doubting the reality of the resurrection somewhere. The ten disciples that had that first privilege were instructed in Acts 1:8 to prepare for the baptism which was to come
upon a larger assembly of the saints in the upper room in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost. It was this baptism which our Lord carried out through the Holy Spirit that birthed the Pentecostal church. The upper room experience has remained with the church till today.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				In Matthew 16:18 Jesus Christ said that He will build His church and the gate of hell shall not prevail. Empowerment of the saints is one of the ways in which Christ’s church is built. We need power for evangelism; we need power to resist the alluring temptations of the enemy. We need that power to help us speak the right word whenever there is the necessity to defend our faith. Jesus Christ did His ministry in the power of the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:14; Acts 10:38) and we can do no less. When the adversary came to tempt Him, He floored the enemy on all counts because He was already empowered by the Holy Spirit. For example Jesus Christ defeated the devil when the latter asked Him to turn stone to bread. Our Lord refused to do so because He is the bread of life. Jesus Christ wants us to operate in the same fashion and that is why He empowered us in Luke 21:15 with a tongue and authority that the enemy cannot gainsay or resist. We need the power of the Holy Ghost for effective evangelism and in all areas.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				It is in the Holy Spirit that we are empowered to destroy the weapons of the enemy and to quench the fiery darts of the wicked. Without Holy Spirit baptism you cannot comprehend the word of God. The word of God remains as ordinary literature and mere information to the unlearned. The unlearned cannot speak the mysteries of the kingdom. You become learned when your tongue is empowered by the Holy Spirit. See Isaiah 50:4. You need the baptism of the Holy Spirit otherwise you will remain as an ordinary Christian without power. Our Lord says access to kingdom power is through Holy Spirit baptism. Rejoice in the Lord.
