            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Acts 16:25</strong> <br>                         
And at midnight Paul
and Silas prayed,
and sang praises unto
God: and the
prisoners heard
them.</code></pre>

				<p>
				Two days ago, I made the point that our worship must be done without the fear of anyone and in the public whenever occasion permits. The worship which we offer unto the Almighty God is not a secret thing. Paul and Silas were engaged in singing hymns and the other prisoners were listening. I am sure their keepers were also
listening. The warders would have been amazed that these two men who were chained down in the horrible cell could still find joy to sing hymns in the worship of the Almighty God. We should be proud to have the privilege to worship the Almighty God, the King of kings and the Lord of all lords, the everlasting God and the Prince of peace.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				As we have seen in diverse cases of those who came to Jesus and worshiped Him, the great Deliverer rose up again to rescue His servants who were jailed for being witnesses for the Saviour. The worship of Paul and Silas caused a shaking and there was a great earthquake. The Spirit of God was moved by the prayers of the duo and whenever there is a shaking there is always a miracle. Paul and Silas became free men as the power of the Holy Spirit broke their chains and they became free. The jailer woke suddenly and when he saw what had happened, he drew his sword to kill himself because he thought that Paul and Silas had escaped. However, Paul calmed him down and told him not to harm himself.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Worship move heaven on our behalf. One way to cause God to rend the heavens (Isaiah 64:1) is to engage in true worship. That was the secret to the divine intervention which Paul and Silas enjoyed. We can banish anxiety when our souls are connected to God through worship. Worship can help us overcome worry and unbelief. True worship enhances our ability to wait on the promises of God. As we express our confidence in God in worship, God will begin to do the uncommon in order to fix our challenges and make us more than conquerors. Worship turns our focus away from momentary challenges and as we focus on God, He will turn to us and work His signs and wonders for our good. Rejoice in the Lord.
