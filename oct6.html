            <h4 align="right">Fri. Oct. 6, 2017</h4>
            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Joshua 7:10-20 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Mk. 1:41</strong> <br>                         
And Jesus, moved with compassion, 
put forth his hand, and touched 
him, and saith unto him, I 
will; be thou clean.</code></pre>

				<p>
				Those who feel too big to worship God may delay the manifestation of their miracles. Worship is such a powerful instrument by which the wise believer can cause God to respond to his heart cry and obtain a miracle with speed. Worship seems to even possess the ability to overrule legal objections to the worshipper’s miracle. For example the
leper who came to Jesus should not be in the public because he was
unclean by the laws of Moses. That was the first obstacle on his way. Number two, Jesus Christ should not have touched the leper as He did because whoever touched him would also be unclean. None of those objections stopped this guy’s miracle as he broke the law by the power of worship and received his healing. He became a notable evangelist thereafter (v. 45)
				</p>
				
				<p>
				There is no person who worshipped God in spirit and in truth in the Bible that Jesus did not heal. Even those who were sick at home got healing when their proxy worshipped Jesus as in the case of the ruler in Matthew 9:18-19, 23-25. In Mark 5:1-20, the madman of Gadara who was filled with demons sighted Jesus and knelt to worship Him. He rose up completely healed and he also became an evangelist. <b>If a madman could worship God, why would a sane man feel too big or too sophisticated to worship God.</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Many believers have missed out on God because worship does not count to them. The beautiful thing with worship is that it provides direct access to God without the need for an intermediary once your heart is pure and your hands are clean. Worship is an act of total surrender to the authority and the sovereignty of God. It is an act of exaltation whereby we lift up Jesus and He says if He be lifted up, He will draw us to Himself (John 12:32). That means that worship provokes divine lifting or divine promotion. I have learnt to worship God for a longer period than the time of petition (supplication and intercession). When you become engrossed in worship, you may find that your prayer requests become few. The reason is that worship helps you to hold unto God as it were and when you enter into that realm, needs pale into insignificance and all you want is more of God. By the time you change to prayer, you will have a lesser job to do. Worship averts delay on the altar of prayer. Rejoice in the Lord.
