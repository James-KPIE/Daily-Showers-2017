            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Gal. 3:28</strong> <br>                         

And God opened her eyes, 
and she saw a well of water; 
and she went, and filled 
the bottle with water, and 
gave the lad drink.</code></pre>

				As I finished writing the piece for yesterday, it occurred to me to touch on the issue of the disadvantages that many children suffer for no fault of theirs, especially the children born out wedlock. Although many nations have swept aside the unfortunate discrimination against these children through legislation, in many societies, children still suffer by the
circumstances of their birth whereas they had no control over the circumstances surrounding their birth. I have heard of children for whom life has been made miserable, especially by the wife of the father of children born out of wedlock. At least I was a witness to the harassment to which a woman repeated subjected one poor boy on this score about thirty–five years ago. That boy was treated like a slave in his own father’s house and since the father was out most of the time, he could not witness the cruel treatment meted out to the boy by madam and the poor boy dared not report to the father because he knew that would fetch him more trouble. Yet, that woman had her own children.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Apart from legislation against discrimination against children in any form, it is also immoral and sinful for anyone to subject those young ones to such agony for no offence that they had committed. The Bible also makes it clear that such discriminations are unscriptural. In the eyes of grace every child is qualified for the good life. Jesus Christ went to Calvary to die that all of us may have life and have it more abundantly.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The wicked mothers who unleash terror on those hapless children should repent for whatsoever a woman sows she shall reap. The wickedness of some women may find an expression of a harvest in the future of their own children. The wise thing to do is to make whatever investment we can in the lives of children who are disadvantaged in order to put a smile on their faces. That way, we have a guarantee of some great blessings in the future, even beyond the generations of our children. Acts of benevolence which are carried out in the fear of God will yield generational dividends (see Psalm 112:1-9). It is ungodly to discriminate against any child by reason of the circumstances surrounding his or her birth. It is crude and callous. If you ever did so, please repent today. If such a child comes your way, see it as an opportunity to beautify a destiny for God. Rejoice in the Lord.
