            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Luke 15:1-10 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Luke 15:10</strong> <br>                         
Likewise, I say unto
you, there is joy in
the presence of the
angels of God over
one sinner that
repenteth.</code></pre>

				<p>
				The joy of seeing a sinner acknowledge our Lord Jesus as his savior and repent of his sins and get saved is our supreme motivation to engage in the glorious task of soul-winning. I remember one early morning in Lagos, Nigeria about twenty two years ago. I was driving to the high court across a long bridge over the Lagos Lagoon. Shortly before I approached the
bridge I stopped to give a ride to a man who was heading for the same end of the city. Within minutes I had engaged him in a discussion on whether he knew Christ and had surrendered his life to Him. He answered in the negative and I quickly brought in the message of salvation after which I asked whether he was ready to accept Jesus as his Lord and Saviour and he said ‘yes.’ I parked the car right on the long bridge and led this man to Christ. That was one of my greatest days on the earth. I have had that privilege once and again and it is such a joy to lead a sinner to Christ. Nothing compares to that joy.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				To be in the company of those who turn people to heaven from the journey to hell is amazing. This is one of the chief motivating factors for those who engage in evangelism. There is nothing that can give a preacher greater fulfillment than the salvation of souls. And that is why it is incumbent on us to always give people the opportunity to accept Jesus Christ in every event such naming of a new child, house dedication, burial service and so on. We must not make presumptions. It is very important that a man should know his spiritual birthday, the day when his night turned to day and he walked into life from darkness. That becomes a day of reckoning and it provides a point of reference in case of any future spiritual challenge to one’s faith. You can look back and recount that glorious occasion and leverage on it to ward off an attack on your stand in Christ. If a man has no assurance of a personal salvation experience, he may be blown here and there by all manners of doctrines.
				
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Paul the apostle always expressed great joy over the good news that his converts were growing in the faith. It is our privilege in redemption to share the joy of seeing saved souls grow into maturity and do exploits, especially the souls that we were privilege to lead to Christ. Each person who is led to Christ can continue the chain by leading other persons to Christ and thereby multiplying the joy and spreading the enthusiasm. Turn to somebody today and share the salvation message. Rejoice in the Lord.
