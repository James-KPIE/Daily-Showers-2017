            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Is. 40:31</strong> <br>                         

But they that wait upon 
the LORD shall renew their 
strength; they shall mount 
up with wings as eagles; they 
shall run, and not be weary; 
and they shall walk, and 
not faint.</code></pre>

				Only God can change the character of a man. It is not in the power of his fellow human being to do so. And the place where a person can witness spirituality taking over from carnality, godliness taking over from wickedness, liberality taking over from selfishness and gentleness taking over from a rancorous spirit is in the place of worship.
				
				<br /><br />
				
				True worship involves a total surrender to God and that is the major necessity for man’s character to be affected by God. When a man enters into the cubicle of worship, continually, and opens his heart to and allows God to minister to his soul, he will begin to see his shortcomings and weaknesses. Man, by nature can ‘hide from God,’ so the more we consciously expose ourselves to God by telling Him the areas where we know we need a change of attitude or character, the more we give God permission to ‘invade’ our most secret places and do the work of transformation. The place of worship is, therefore, the right place to seek God to touch our lives for the dramatic change we need in our character.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Many couples get embroiled in quarrels over attitudinal issues which they wanted to resolve by human mechanism. The husband insists on the wife’s change of attitude and the wife does the same. Each one of the couple keeps pointing out the errors of the other but none of them would admit where he or she is wrong. That is a problem to be resolved through worship. Authentic worship reveals you to yourself. When you engage in true worship, the Holy Spirit places a mirror before you to see who you really are, and you cannot deny yourself. If you are truly humble you will submit to the searchlight of the Holy Spirit and begin to ask for His help in the transformation you desire.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The plague of our age is that we do not tarry in the place of worship. God wants to do more in our lives than we can ever imagine, through our worship. The place of worship is a place of exchange–where we exchange our unholiness for God’s holiness, our impurity for God’s purity, our weaknesses for God’s strength, our inability for God’s ability and our foolishness for God’s wisdom. If you desire that anyone change his or her character, expose him or her to consistent and true worship because only God can change a man. Rejoice in the Lord.
