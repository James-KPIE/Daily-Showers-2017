            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Gen. 16: 2</strong> <br>                         
And Sarai said unto Abram, 
Behold now, the LORD hath 
restrained me from bearing: 
I pray thee, go in unto my 
maid; it may be that I may 
obtain children by her. And 
Abram hearkened to the 
voice of Sarai.</code></pre>

				The eighteenth covenant credential of father Abraham was that he held Sarah his wife in honour. The passage of scripture for our reading for today’s exhortation is not taken to approve the counsel of Sarah per se. No. The passage is chosen because we have another lesson to learn from it. The lesson is that husbands must listen to their wives and where their counsel is not ungoldly, the husbands should heed such counsel. For example, in Esther 6:13, Zerech the wife of Haman warned him not to proceed to carry out his deadly plot against
Mordecai but Haman was too far gone to repent and reconsider his ways. As a result, he perished in the gallows which he prepared for Mordecai.<br /><br />
Wise husbands respect their wives and listen to them but foolish husbands do not. In I Samuel 25, Nabal offended King David because he dealt unwisely with the young men whom David sent to make a request of him. When David heard, he promised to unleash terror on Nabal. It was Nabal’s wife that went to apologize on his behalf. The wife emphasized the foolishness of her husband in I Samuel 25:25. Perhaps evil would have been averted if Nabal had listened to his wife and behaved contrary to how he did when the servants of David got to him.<br /><br />
Our wives are not our slaves. God sent them to us as our helpers. There is a place, a vacuum which the wife should fill in a man’s life. If you honour the woman, she will seek your good interest and if you are a believer in Christ, your wife should be your first prayer–partner. She is the one who should know your weaknesses and take such to God through intercession. Of course, a wise woman would not expose her husband’s weaknesses or take him for granted. The wife must respect the husband as well. Respect in marriage is mutual.<br /><br />
Abraham honoured Sarah and respected her. Let us learn from him. Rejoice in the Lord.
