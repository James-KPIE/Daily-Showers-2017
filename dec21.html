            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Ecclesiastics 4:9-12 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Eccl. 4:9</strong> <br>                         
Two are better than
one; because they have
a good reward for their
labour.</code></pre>

				<p>
				The common foe of all believers is the devil. Our enemy is the adversary who enslaves the soul of men and would keep people in bondage and send them on an errand to kill, to maim, steal and destroy. Our enemy to fight is the one who stands as the backbone of the physical
enemy that we can see all around. That is why we fight spiritual battles
and not physical battles. And that is why the weapons of our warfare are not carnal or physical. We are called out to fight the spiritual war. God did not equip us to fight physical battles as children of light who contend with the powers of darkness. This truth is so important because it is when we conquer in the spirit realm that even the enemies which we can see can be stopped by God on our behalf. And that is why God was very unhappy with David when he embarked on the census of the soldiers of Israel as if it was their numerical strength that had brought them victories.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				It is therefore easy for us to understand the reason why we must all come together to fight a collective battle because as citizens of the kingdom we have a common enemy who we can only fight not with lethal weapons but with spiritual weapons. Therefore, our focus today is on the immeasurable energy we can generate in the spirit realm through being united as one to face a common foe. This is as true in the kingdom to which we belong as citizens and even in our homes as husbands and wives. I will recommend the film tilled War Room to every Christian couple around the world. It is a great revelation to know that several couples all over the ages have dissipated so much energy in fighting one another and trying to change one another and rather than build such homes they have ended up in tearing them apart. Such couples never really enjoy marriage but on the contrary they are enduring it and that is not God’s plan when He instituted marriage.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The Bible speaks of the various blessings of oneness or unity in our reading passage for today. Profiting, protection, defence and warmness are some of the blessings that unity provides. Plus, it is the gateway to obtaining the much needed anointing for the end-time harvest and exploits. As citizens of the kingdom let us concentrate on our common enemy and stay united to harness the kingdom power that has been released unto us. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
