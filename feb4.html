									<h3 style=color:red>Daily Reading: 1 Chro. 29:10-20 </h3>
									<pre><code> <b style=color:red>M.V: I Kings 3:5</b> <br />                         
In Gibeon the LORD
appeared to
Solomon in a dream
by night: and God
said, Ask what I shall
give thee.</code></pre> 

									<p>
Our giving always begins from God. He created us. He draws us close to Himself to teach us the principles of His kingdom. One of such teachings is that if we give, it shall (not may) be given to us. This inspires us to be liberal and this is the supernatural gateway to kingdom wealth empowerment. After He has inspired us by His
Spirit (Job 32:8), He directs our path in the way to go about our sowing the seeds by locating fertile grounds (Psalm 32:8 and Isaiah 32:8). So, if anyone of us becomes a giver, he or she owes it all to God. Beyond this, whatever we give is what came from God in the first place. That was the emphasis of David in verses 14 and 16 of our scripture text for today. God created all things.
									</p>
									<p>
My intention, today, is to complete the story of yesterday by highlighting the fact that God has done much more for me and my family than we can ever dream of doing in His church or for other people. The value of the precious blood of Jesus that saves us cannot be quantified. The blood of Jesus is worth more than all the resources of this earth tapped and untapped put together. Indeed, one saved soul is worth more than the wealth of the whole universe. So, when compared to what God has done, the best giver in God’s kingdom has not done anything worthy of commendation. It is our privilege to give so the heaven of blessings can be opened wider over our lives. People have given to me much more than I have given to other people. God has raised helpers for me practically in all areas of life. It is amazing. The acceptance and patronage that this manual enjoys has been growing steadily for eleven years. The demand for it increases year after year. The testimonies of the esteemed users of the manual all over the world are my wages. You need to hear such testimonies at the last year’s annual Retreat for the readers. It will come up again on July 15th, 2017. What more should I ask from God! He outgives each of us and that is the truth.									</p>
									<p>
Solomon visited the Lord to give an offering of appreciation with a thousand burnt offerings and the Lord gave him an open cheque. May that be your portion as you become an addicted giver. Rejoice in the Lord.									</p>

											<h3>Prayer Points </h3>

												<li>Thank You Father for giving me the “giving” grace.</li>
												<li>I receive much more grace to be a blessing to other people, in Jesus name.</li>
