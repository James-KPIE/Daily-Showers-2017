            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Genesis 37:5-20 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Gen. 37:21</strong> <br>                         
And Reuben heard it, and 
he delivered him out of 
their hands; and said, 
Let us not kill him.</code></pre>

				<p>
				You cannot kill the dream of a man who operates under divine favour. Joseph’s dreams were not ordinary dreams. They were divinely inspired. And that was what made it impossible for his brothers to abort them. Joseph’s troubles started when his brothers found that their father loved him
specially. They never looked beyond the natural. If they had prayed or sought the face of God, perhaps they would have known that his dreams were divine. Joseph had an appointment with destiny and God’s stamp was upon the future that he saw. God was committed to bring it to pass.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				What amazes me in the story of Joseph is the quietness he maintained in his ordeals both in the hands of his brothers and even in Potiphar’s house. He just watched the drama which his brothers were performing. He never argued with them. He did not struggle with them. It would have been foolish for him to engage hisbrothers in any physical fight. As his brothers hatched one evil plan after the other, Joseph was not alarmed because of the certainty of the vision that he saw. His brothers had taken his coat of many colours but they could not take his dream. They threw him into the pit but his dream could not be buried in the pit. Thereafter, they plotted to sell him off so that the ‘locus’ of the manifestation of his dream could be permanently altered and frustrated, but God was watching. He is the Almighty God who overrules where the enemy does not want Him to rule. He watched and granted permission to those wicked brothers to do all that they did with one caveat–enemy conspiracy must move Joseph nearer his throne!
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Of great importance and useful insight is how the unseen hands of God kept Joseph from being killed. God always raised a voice among this same team of dream aborters to preserve Joseph. In verses 21-22, Reuben delivered Joseph from the other brothers so they would not kill him. In verse 26-27 it was the turn of Judah to rescue him from being killed. He suggested that they sell him and they agreed. Do you have a dream that enjoys divine approval? Stay with it and abide in Jesus and watch God preserve you. Rejoice in the Lord.
