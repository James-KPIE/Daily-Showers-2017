            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: 1 Kgs. 17:6</strong> <br>                         
And the ravens brought him 
bread and flesh in the 
morning, and bread and 
flesh in the evening; 
and he drank of 
the brook.</code></pre>

				In our Bible passage for today, we see the sovereignty of God in the choice of what He would do to accomplish His purpose. He is supreme and He controls all things and His power is not subject to any other power. We must trust Him at all times to provide solutions to our problems by whatever means He chooses. It is our responsibility to follow Him and do whatever He will have us do, as we cooperate
with God for the accomplishment of His purpose in and for our lives. We are the clay and He is the potter and the clay cannot query the method which the potter may choose to use in moulding the clay. (Isaiah 64:8). As far as solutions to our problems are concerned, we must choose to be at rest whenever we trust God for solutions. We cannot dictate to Him how and when He should do what He will do and when we do so in prayer, the answer is still subject to His sovereignty. And we cannot query His decision and His timing.

				<p>God provided the solution to Elijah’s problem of scarcity of food during the drought by sending ravens that brought bread and meat to Elijah twice a day. Ravens are known to be stingy birds. God wanted to teach us a lesson by using a stingy bird to bring food during the season of scarcity. It means that God’s riches are beyond our comprehension. He has created rivers in the desert and made the wilderness a pool of water. He is Jehovah Jireh who can bring forth a ram from the thicket of the bush on the mountain. In 2 Kings 3:20-21, He caused water to flow in the land over night without rain or dew.

Are you presently going through a financial or economic crisis? That bus stop is not your last bus stop. Financial dryness can be worrisome. It becomes tougher when there are mouths to feed apart from your own. Many of us have been there before. There are occasions when the family slept without any food in the store for breakfast for the following morning. Yet, it was not a time to give up in despair. Rather it was a time to lift up our eyes unto the hills from where our help comes. Some of us have learnt through experience to keep sowing our seeds in the days of abundance. God would, often, open the windows of heaven and send us a harvest when the days of scarcity come. May He supply all your needs. Rejoice in the Lord.
