            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Deut. 30:19-20 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Josh. 24:15</strong> <br>                         
And if it seem evil unto you 
to serve the LORD, choose you
this day whom ye will serve; 
whether the gods which your
fathers served that were on 
the other side of the flood, 
or the gods of the Amorites, 
in whose land ye dwell: but as
for me and my house, we will 
serve the LORD.</code></pre>

				<p>
					We shall go further on our reasoning on the power of one today, as we consider the power of one choice. The destiny of every person is directly influenced by the choices that he or she makes. Every adult woman or man is a product of the choices they made when they were young. What we are today is not entirely a result of our background as some people will say. Rather, it is much more the choices they made early in life. A young American said he would be the richest lawyer in United States. He made that statement at the age of four. The young boy decided to give it all it took and he became a lawyer. While he was well under thirty five
years, he had a staff strength of eighty five persons in his law firm
among whom were thirty seven lawyers. Abraham Lincoln was provoked to make right choices when, at the age of four, he stood by his mother’s bed side as she was about to die and she said to him ‘Abe, be a man.’ His uncommon struggles and an enduring political adventure of thirty-seven years ultimately yielded to him the American presidency.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					We all make choices daily. Poor choices always lead to losses and some times, tragedy. A man became furious when he had an argument with his wife in the house. In anger, he rushed out to drive away from the house. He was not quite composed, so instead of engaging the reverse gear, he mistakenly engaged the ‘drive’ gear, pressed the pedal very hard and the car crashed into their house. He sustained serious injuries and damaged both the car and the building. You have a choice as to how to react to whatever people say. You have a choice to let another person dictate your pace or be on top by yourself. You also have the choice between keeping quiet or engaging in an oral battle. The Bible says a fool is thought to be wise when he keeps quiet. Whether your marriage will succeed or fail is a matter of your choices.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Choices will determine whether you will die poor or rich; whether you will have friends or increase the number of your enemies; whether you will go to heaven or hell; whether you will be remembered for good or for evil. And these choices are made everyday. Be careful to make the right choices. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
