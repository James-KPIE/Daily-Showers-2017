            <h4 align="right">Sun. Feb. 26, 2017</h4>
            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Genesis 15:1-7 </h3>
            <pre><code> M.V: Gen. 15:2 <br>                         
And Abram said,
Lord GOD, what wilt
thou give me, seeing I
go childless, and the
steward of my house
is this Eliezer of
Damascus?</code></pre>God desires that we talk with Him rather than just talk to Him. God is a relational Father and a responsive Listener. Most times, we talk to Him and we will not wait to hear Him speak to us before we disappear from the altar of prayer. The reverse seems to be the case with Abraham. God spoke to him more than he spoke to God. If we study the life of Abraham very well, we will discover that God was the initiator of most of their conversations. This was Abraham’s <b>fifth</b> covenant credential- ability to hear God speak and engage God in destiny-related conversations.<br><br>Abraham would take his time with God and ask questions whenever he needed clarifications. He feared God in loving Him and he enjoyed the company of God each time he was in His presence. <b>Beloved, divine presence is the greatest spiritual asset of a believer.</b> It must be what we desire most. It is always my number one request before the Lord. If you enjoy divine presence, you will enjoy peace. If you operate in the power of His presence, your enemies are in trouble because whoever fights you automatically fights God. And whoever fights God is a loser. Little wonder Abraham won all the battles he fought because the Lord was with him. He was bold before God. Somehow Abraham understood that it is those who ask God questions that are entitled to answers. He asked God if his steward named Eliezer would be the one to inherit his fortune if he died childless! He was frank and sincere with God. He did not pretend. That is how God wants us to relate with Him. He knows all about us yet He wants us to tell Him about our fears and worries because He loves our conversation. That is proof of His love for us.<br><br><br>Thank God that Abraham did not keep quiet. His questions caused God to begin to show him specific pictures of his future (see verse 5). Earlier on in Genesis 13:14, God had shown Abraham the picture of an enlarged inheritance, now He showed him the picture of multiplied descendants. Start talking with God. He will clear your doubts and show you direction. Rejoice in the Lord.<br><br><div
