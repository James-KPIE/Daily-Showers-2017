							<h1>CONTROLLER OF ALL RESOURCES</h1>

							<!-- Text -->
								<section>
									<h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>							<h4 align="right">Wed. Feb. 1, 2017</h4>
									
									<h3 style=color:red>Daily Reading: Psalm 23 </h3>
									<pre><code> <b style=color:red>M.V: Psalm 50:10</b> <br />                         
For every beast of
the forest is
mine, and the
cattle upon a
thousand hills.</code></pre> 

									<p>
Most humbly, I have continued to refer to God as the Intercontinental Controller of all economic resources. He distributes natural resources among the all nations. I am not sure there is any nation on the surface of the earth that does not import something from another nation in exchange (probably) for
what it exports to that other nation. I went for a one-month study in the ministry in far away Malaysia in 2002 and I was shocked to hear that the country was importing water from Singapore. At that time, the two countries were negotiating for the renewal of the contract for that product in the course of their bilateral relations. God, in His wisdom has spread His resources around the world. As I write this piece, wild fires are raging in some part of United States while a part of United Kingdom has been experiencing devastating flood. When the temperature in some parts of the world is below zero degree, people are experiencing scorching heat that causes brain waves elsewhere. Great is our God.
									</p>
									<p>
The truth that God owns all resources should warn us against hoarding and inspire is to give more and more. Fortunately, many of us have learnt that until much goes out of our little, our little will never become much. So, when we are in need, we find opportunity to give to those who are in greater need than we are. It works. The Almighty God is the Lord of the harvest. He initiated the seed-harvest strategy as a kingdom covenant strategy to cushion the pressure of needs upon our hearts. The more we find opportunity to give, the more blessed we are. I am leading the church which I pastor in the culture of living the blessed life of changing our prayers to ‘God make me a blessing’ from the common and usual prayer of ‘God bless me.’ To be sure, there is nothing wrong with the latter. However, God asked Abraham to be a blessing after He had blessed him. I find it a bit difficult as I get closer to sixty years to keep praying God bless me everyday. I want to invest more and more in praying for other people and being a blessing to them. That way, my channel of blessing remains open. Our prayers will reflect whether we are self-absorbed or whether we care about other people. Selfishness shrinks blessings.									
									</p>
									<p>
You can connect to the covenant of blessing by being born again and practicing the covenant of giving. Jesus Christ is the Controller of all resources. You cannot be stranded in Him. Rejoice in the Lord.									
									</p>
