            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Matt. 7:8</strong> <br>

				<p>
				We have been dealing with the causes of delay for some days and we shall consider the issue of prayerlessness today. In particular we want to look at the case of people who cannot tarry at the corridor of prayers. To want to pray is one thing but to be ready to keep praying until answer comes is another thing. Many Christians are weak in this area. We all know how long it could take to see the president of a nation or the
governor of a state. At times you get an appointment to see them and when you get there you are told that due to another engagement the governor is not available. And that may happen several times. Then a day may come when he is available and you are penned down to see him at 10:00am but he could only attend to you by 6:00pm. You will be praising God when you finally meet him. You see, you have waited that long because you are the one that needs him. He does not need you. Now, do you compare God with a president or the governor? Yet many Christians only pray for some hours and they give up and begin to complain. Prayer demands importunity.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Delay may occur because we do not pray aright or we give up easily on the altar of prayer. That is why Jesus told the story of the judge to whom the poor woman cried persistently for justice. One of the old philosophers once said that the problem of mortals is that they don’t ask and when they ask they don’t insist enough. Serious prayer requires a determination not to take ‘no’ for an answer, especially when you have established that it is the will of God for you to have what you seek. It requires determination and effort to wait at the doorpost of the Almighty. Are you asking how long you should tarry in prayer? The answer is–as long as your joy over the issue is not yet full. It was God that said you should keep asking until your joy is full. So, follow His counsel and you will not miss out on Him. Amen.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				You may need to check your life from time to time whether any of those hindrances to prayer does exist in your life. These include sin, unbelief, unforgiveness, lustful desires that you seek to satisfy through prayer, failure to pay your vows etc. You may also wish to explore Matthew 18:19 by finding a faithful partner in prayer who can join faith with you on the altar of prayer. But don’t forget that you must be ready to press on in order to avoid delay. Do not delay to ask and when you ask, be ready to insist. Rejoice in the Lord.
