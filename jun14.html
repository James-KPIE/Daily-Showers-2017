This book of the law
shall not depart out
of thy mouth; but
thou shalt meditate
therein day and
night, that thou
mayest observe to do
according to all that
is written therein: for
then thou shalt make
thy way prosperous,
and then thou shalt
have good success.</code></pre>

				<p>
				We can wake up daily to expect miracles from God even as we accept scriptural responsibility for our increase, promotion and enlargement. That is the reason why we must see with the eyes of faith. In Deuteronomy 2:24, God told Moses and the Israelites the following “Rise up, set out on your journey and go over the Valley of the Arnon. Behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to take possession, and contend with him in battle.” There are two issues in that single instruction-that the Israelites should see victory as they were
preparing to take the land. The Lord had given them the victory. The second issue is that they should brace up for a fight. How does that apply to us? Our inner eyes must be kept disciplined to see the promises of God as being fulfilled in our lives. That is why Apostle Paul prayed as he did in Ephesians 3:16 that the Lord may grant us to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in our inner being.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				To possess our possession in Christ, we must continually ensure that we are spiritually alert and our minds must not be allowed to become dull, otherwise we can miss out on God. God stayed with Joshua after the initial empowerment which God imparted unto him in Joshua 3:7- the assurance of divine presence just as the Lord did with Moses. Then, as the battles progressed, God ensured that Joshua did not lose sight of victory in the spirit. Battles are won or lost from within us. So, in Joshua 6:2, God told the war captain again: “See, I have given Jericho in your hand, with its king and mighty men of valour.” That would make Joshua to know that men of war were waiting-trained fighters with years of battlefield experience. However, because he had been trained to see victory ahead of the battle, Joshua was going to lead his team with the supernatural mentality of a conqueror or indeed as a more than conqueror. That was very crucial in winning the war campaigns which Joshua did well.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				You too can begin to change the picture of the future that you have long painted on your mind especially if they are negative. Who tells you that failure is final? Who says where you are today is your final bus stop? Who says financial indebtedness cannot experience a turnaround? With God, no problem or situation is cast in stone. Let us see as God sees. He is our God with whom all things are possible for you, if you are with Him. Rejoice in the Lord.
