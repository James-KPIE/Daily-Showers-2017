            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Luke 8:43-48 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Lk. 8:45</strong> <br>                         
And Jesus said, Who touched me? 
When all denied, Peter and they 
that were with him said, Master, 
the multitude throng thee and press 
thee, and sayest thou, Who 
touched me?</code></pre>

				<p>
				We want to look at the cases of those who pressed unto God for the termination of what they knew to have destroyed their peace, comfort and progress. The woman with the issue of blood for twelve years got tired of the delay in her enjoyment of sound health and she took action. She made the move that ended her woes. You see, until you are tired of sickness you may not enjoy total health. Until you are tired of poverty you may not see prosperity. When you are down and all
you do is bemoan your situation without taking steps, heaven may also just be watching you. God is not the helper of the docile. In some cases all we do is pray without taking actions. Many of us are full with knowledge of what to do to move to the next level but we become immobile when action is to be taken. It was Jim Rohn who said <blockquote><b>“Don’t let your learning lead to knowledge but let your learning lead to action.”</b></blockquote>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				You may need to personally make the move that will terminate your delay and heaven will respond positively to you. I have read Genesis 26 carefully and found that the only instruction God gave to Isaac was not to move to Egypt. What next? With the benefit of divine grace, Isaac perceived that it was the right time to sow You see, when your mind is turned towards God by being Spirit–filled, you will take steps that align with the divine agenda for your life. So, Isaac went ahead to sow his seed. He took a bold step of faith that terminated famine in his own life while other native people of the land were walking about hungry and worried. Action–oriented believers are heaven–shakers. Each time you make a move like the woman with the issue of blood or like Isaac, heaven responds positively to you. Permit me to share this testimony. On one Sunday morning in 2009, I found that I had not much money with me apart from that Sunday offering. So, I sowed a seed of one thousand naira, trusting and believing God for divine intervention. I went out on the following morning (Monday) to see someone I had worked for. I came back with three million naira. God honours the law of seedtime and harvest because He initiated it. Grace prompted me to sow the seed and heaven responded with a bountiful harvest.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				What move do you need to make today? To sow a seed? To call someone and tell him or her that you have forgiven him or her? To step out into a new venture? To visit your abandoned project site and pray? Take a step, make the move and watch God bless you again. Rejoice in the Lord.
