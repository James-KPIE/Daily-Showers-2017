For ye know the
grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ, that,
though he was rich,
yet for your sakes he
became poor, that ye
through his poverty
might be rich.</code></pre>

					Your breakthrough or success may be waiting for just one seed to be sown. That is why we must never get tired in sowing our seed of faith. Only God knows the timing and the size of our harvest. God has graciously given us the privilege to sow our seed and the discretion to sow the seed lies with us. However, we need to persist
in sowing the seed because we do not know which one shall
prosper. It is within God’s power to cause every seed that we sow to command a big harvest. God may also allow the harvest to be little. Ours is to sow the seed and trust the Lord of harvest to favour us with His promised harvest. We can count on His faithfulness.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					We should learn to be patient and expectant as seed planters. Apostle James told us that we need to be patient just like the farmer needs to be patient after he has planted his seed. All crops do not mature at the same time. When a farmer plants corn and yam, the two crops will mature for harvest after some months, the corn first and then the yam. The planter of yam must wait for a longer time. It takes a longer time for a baby elephant to become a full-grown elephant than it will take a puppy to grow to a mature dog. Big harvest may require a longer time and we must be prepared to wait. However, we must also avoid sowing sparingly, but sow bountifully.
				</p>

					Solomon went to Mount Gibeon to offer a thousand offerings to the Lord in appreciation for the throne which he did not fight for. Absalom and Adonijah fought for the throne and Absalom staged a palace coup that ousted David from the throne. Adonijah schemed to have his own supporters too but God graciously gave the throne to Solomon. So, Solomon went to the mount with his seed of thanksgiving. In response, the Lord gave him a blank cheque- he was told to ask for whatsoever he wanted and he asked for wisdom. His single outing met with divine approval and blessing. Even his request was met with delight in God’s present. He laid down one seed which turned everything around. Keep sowing your seed. Faithful is the Lord of harvest who will not let you sow your seed in vain. Rejoice in the Lord.
