					The power of ‘one thing’ is extraordinary. It is a wonderful experience to find out what could happen when we do the one thing which our breakthrough or miracle has been waiting for us to do. During the New Year prayers which we were conducting in a church recently, we prayed that the God of grace will push us to do that
thing which will cause our desired miracle to manifest. A man does not need to do all things to secure a financial, business or breakthrough in ministry. And that is why divine guidance is the greatest asset of the believer. Whoever is guided by God is sure to enjoy life in the miraculous. That was the case of Abraham, David and also Solomon. We shall concentrate on Abraham’s story today.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Abraham had been blessed, prophetically, by God. However, he was waiting for the manifestations of the promises. Before Isaac was born, Abraham waited for some years. At a time, he asked God whether his seed shall come from Eliezer but God assured him that his seed shall come from his own body. So, he kept on believing God and praising God, while he waited. Isaac was only released for a specific time when Abraham entertained the three strangers. They were figuratively representing the triune God. After the three men had eaten, they spoke as one person in Genesis 18:10 saying that Isaac shall be born by that time in the following year. The announcement of the arrival of Isaac was waiting for one thing-the seed of liberality or generosity from Abraham. Thank God for Abraham’s hospitality.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The test which Abraham was to pass was also to pave way for God to have the opportunity to release upon him irreversible blessings. Thank God that Abraham did not withhold Isaac. God swore blessings to Abraham because he surrendered Isaac and that was the thing which provoked God to act as He did. Abraham gave Isaac to God and God blessed him and spoke multiplication to Isaac-the seed of Abraham. The One thing which Abraham did brought down generational blessings that we are still reaping today through faith. It is a good prayer for us to pray and ask God to show us what thing we are to do in order to gain access to the blessing we desire. Rejoice in the Lord.
