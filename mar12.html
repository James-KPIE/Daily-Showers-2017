And Abraham stood up, 
and bowed himself to 
the people of the land, 
even to the children 
of Heth.</code></pre>

				The seventeenth covenant credential of Abraham was his humility. Thank God for Abraham. He was a man of grace indeed. If there was a man who should have been proud, it was Abraham, because he was rich and highly influential. He was great in every sense of the word. Numerous mouths fed on
his bill every day. Yet Abraham was very humble. He took a bow before the people in Genesis 23:7 and again in verse 12. Rich people in this present world would hardly do that especially when they address people who are of lesser financial worth and influence.<br /><br />
We are all required to be humble before God. Humility is the gateway to honour according to Proverbs 15:33. In the book of James, we are told to humble ourselves before God so He will draw near to us. The proud cannot enjoy divine attention or divine partnership. God hates the proud. A proud person thinks he has got what he has by his own efforts. He thinks the world revolves around him. The proud person looks down on everybody around him. Such a person will, unknowingly, chase away the people who can be of help in solving his problems. The leprous Naaman showed some traces of pride when he got to Elisha because he thought Elisha would come down to salute him and acknowledge his military status. His social status was already dented by his leprosy anyway. Naaman, however, pocketed his pride and listened to the Hebrew housemaid who directed him to Israel for his healing. Thank God, he swallowed his pride and went to Jordan to dip himself into the river; otherwise he would die a leper.<br /><br />
Pride is a destroyer. Abraham remained humble to the end. He respected the priest of God to whom he paid his tithe. He respected unknown people like the strangers he entertained. He respected his in–laws as he sent gifts to them when his servant went to fetch a wife for Isaac. Let us emulate Abraham’s humility. Rejoice in the Lord.
