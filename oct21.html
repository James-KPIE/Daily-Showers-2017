				Jacob’s mother had sent him to go and stay with Laban for a few days so as to allow Esau’s anger to cool down and possibly change his mind from his determination to kill Jacob. But things turned out differently for Jacob. As if God wanted to punish Jacob for the sins he had committed in robbing Esau of his heritage from their father, Jacob became a labourer in the business enterprise of Laban and the latter made life difficult for him. Jacob fell in love with Rachel
and forgot that he was to spend a few days with Laban and return home. Laban tricked him into spending fourteen years to marry Rachel eventually. Laban could have told Jacob at the onset of his courtship with Rachel the rule that the elder sister must marry first. But the Bible says those years were like a few days to Jacob because he was in love. It appears Jacob met his match in his uncle Laban. To make matters worse, Jacob’s salary was reviewed downwards a few times instead of receiving a raise. Then he cried to God in Genesis 30:30 and pleaded his righteousness in Genesis 30:33.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The God of Abraham and Isaac came to the rescue of Jacob through a supernatural intervention which turned things around miraculously in Jacob’s favour. God gave Jacob an idea by which some cattle of Laban with a special feature were made to cross themselves as they drink water, looking at some peeled rods. In the end the particular specie became multiplied and generated much more revenue for Jacob and he became richer than his employer. The Almighty God caused wealth to change hands in the favour of Jacob thereby terminating delay and stagnation in his life. <b>Jacob enjoyed economic emancipation through divine intervention.</b>

				Have you been working for other people to eat contrary to Isaiah 65:22? Get ready for your deliverance. Turn your life over to Jesus the Saviour and if you have done so, stand strong in the covenant. Become an addicted tither even from that very little that you earn. Then turn to God in prayers and seek His face for a turn around. Unlike Jacob you need not plead your own righteousness but the righteousness of Jesus because you are now under grace. Of course you must tap into grace for the enablement to do all you need to do, so you don’t violate God’s law to your own disadvantage. As you tarry at the altar of prayer, may God answer your prayers. Amen. Rejoice in the Lord.
