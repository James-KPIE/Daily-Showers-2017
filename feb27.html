            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Psalm 27:1-4 </h3>
            <pre><code><b style="color:red">M.V: Job 22:21</b> <br>                         
Acquaint now thyself
with him, and be at
peace: thereby good
shall come unto thee.</code></pre>If there is one place where we can cultivate friendship with God, it is at the altar. Friendship with God was the sixth covenant credential of Abraham. He had sought the Lord by responding to Him through uncommon faith. He demonstrated uncommon obedience in an atmosphere of pure idolatry. He was an addicted worshipper of God at the altar where he enjoyed conversational relationship with the Almighty God. These are some of the factors that qualified Abraham for what we call uncommon reward according to Genesis 15:1.<br><br>Without friendship, it is very hard to develop trust. We shall consider that trust factor on March 5. The Bible tells us that a man who desires to have friends must himself be friendly. Some Christians are not friendly. A few of such brethren claim that is their nature. I do not know which nature they are referring to – whether it is an allusion to their original sinful nature in the first Adam or their regenerated nature in the last Adam, that is our Lord Jesus Christ. The foundation for pure friendship is the love of God in our heart. Genuine love grows friendship effortlessly. Abraham cultivated a profitable friendship with God as a way of life. Can you imagine how long Abraham kept God with him in his unprecedented intercession for Sodom and Gomorrah from Genesis 18:23 to the end of the chapter? God has time for everyone who wants to spend time with Him. In that long conversation, God left Abraham only when the old man had nothing else to plead. In our days we spend short time in His presence and He won’t force Himself on us.<br><br>It is my thought that only those who maintain pure friendship with God can develop friendship with other brethren. If your friendship with God is not well-grounded, I can guarantee that your earthly friendship with other people may not be at its best. What you gain from your relationship with God is what you bring into your relationship with men. Think over it. Rejoice in the Lord.<br><br><div
