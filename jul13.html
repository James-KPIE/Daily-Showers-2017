            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Galatians 5:22-25 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Eph. 5:11</strong> <br>                         
And have no fellowship with 
the unfruitful works of 
darkness, but rather 
reprove them.</code></pre>

				We shall consider the fruits of the Spirit in specific details today. Love is the first fruit mentioned in the passage before us. It is so fundamental that without it, we cannot produce any other fruit which is mentioned, easily. For example, without love your patience will soon run out. Your ability to be liberal through
goodness will soon expire if the taproot of love in you has not grown deeply. We are speaking of the love which moved our Lord Jesus to give His life on the cross so that we could be saved.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				In the 2015 edition of DAILY SHOWERS, I treated the subject of love for forty–five days as I shared the attributes of this all–important fruit. The more of God’s love that floods your heart, the more joyful you can be. If you hinder the flow of joy then you will place a limit on the blessings of redemption that can come your way. See Isaiah 12:3 again. Joy creates an atmosphere where the Holy Spirit can operate in us, through us and around us. For example, you will always enjoy divine presence and provision in your house if you can sustain the momentum of joy and a life of praise therein, as opposed to a home where people disagree and quarrel and argue all the time. See Proverbs 15:15. Some Christian homes are not conditioned for an unending visitation from the Holy Spirit. The truth is that a place where there is joy and where praise is offered continually, the presence of God will be real because God loves to be there. See Psalm 22:3.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Gentleness, meekness and temperance flow together. Rash behaviour will be far from us and we grow to be more humble as we allow the word of God to dwell in us and influence our character. We are able to endure the shortcomings of other people and we do not become unnecessarily judgmental. Our faith will also grow in proportion to our learning and understanding of the word of life. We considered our heritage of peace a few days ago. The more we love people the more we will be at peace with them. The good thing about the fruit of the Holy Spirit is that each can grow as we yield more and more to divine instructions in the word of God. Then we shall be fruitful more and more. Rejoice in the Lord.
