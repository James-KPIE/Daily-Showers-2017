            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Pro. 13:22</strong> <br>                         
A good man leaveth an inheritance to 
his children's children: and the 
wealth of the sinner is laid up for 
the just.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				Abraham loved God, respected his wife and trained his children. He took care of all his children especially his covenant child Isaac. When the time of his death drew near, Abraham gave them inheritance. This is the twentieth covenant credential of Abraham. In Genesis 18:19 which we considered yesterday, God did not discriminate between Abraham’s covenant child and
the other children because He gave grace to Abraham to be a good father to them all and this is very instructive. The Almighty God is fair to all and does not want any child to be at a disadvantage for being born out of wedlock as we find in some cultures and under the laws of some nations. To do so is to punish a child for an offence he or she knows nothing about. Any father or mother who brings forth a child should nurture such a child under the fear of God and make sure there is provision for the growth of that child.<br /><br />
Parental responsibility is very important before God. You will recall that Eli lost his priesthood and died before his time because his children were poorly trained. They were unruly and grossly immoral. They committed profanities right at the altar of God in the temple. When God sent a strong warning through an unlikely source, that is the young Samuel (which should make Eli sober), the old man dared God to do what He pleased. That irresponsible reply to God’s kind message must have provoked God to permit almost the whole family to be wiped out in one single day.<br /><br />
The Bible says children are the Lord’s heritage but many parents don’t seem to ask what that means. God is interested in the destiny of every child. He loves children. Jesus Christ warned the adult crowd not to hinder the children from coming to Him. He loved their company. He also said that whoever treats the children well will receive blessing from God. Whatever good you do for a young child, God deems it an act you do on His behalf. If you maltreat them, God will deal with you. Many people do not realize this so when they suffer hardship at times, they are looking for imaginary enemies to curse to fall down and die. Have you ever maltreated or abused a child? You better repent. Follow Abraham’s path. Be a responsible parent. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
