            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Ecclesiastics 11:1-6 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Gen. 2:5-6</strong> <br>                         
And every plant of the 
field before it was in 
the earth, and every herb 
of the field before it 
grew: for the LORD God 
had not caused it to 
rain upon the earth, 
and there was not a 
man to till the ground.
But there went up a mist 
from the earth, and watered 
the whole face of the ground</code></pre>

				We shall build on the message for yesterday in the sermon for today for two reasons. The first one is because we need to say a word more on the other side of 1 Peter 3:7. Wives also need to know that heaven honours them when they honour their husbands. Indeed the Bible links failure of women to do so as a possible cause of complications during delivery. The Bible does not contradict itself. Yes, a Christian who is pregnant is regarded as a Hebrew woman. By reason of the covenant, she should deliver with ease. The hospital ward for her is the delivery ward, not labour ward because she does
not go there to labour. But she risks labouring there if she despises her husband. Disobedience to God’s word may hinder God’s promises from being performed in our lives. <b>Delay can be terminated through obedience.</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The second reason is to add a word or two on the seed principle. Cloud loading means that you sow your seed continuously even when you do not know how the harvest may come. Our memory verse shows us that God also operated the seed principle in doing the work of creation. Rain was formed from the mist that gathered from the earth. The vapour gathered up in the sky and when they reach condensation level, rain is formed and it pours on the earth. That is why my mentor says that as long as you have a seed to sow, your tomorrow is opened up to a blessing. The seed which leaves your hand never leaves your life. Speed of accomplishment in any area can be gained by the power of seed–sowing. Your seed is a representation of your need before God. It calls the attention of God to your area of need. We never do God a favour by sowing a seed. He needs nothing from us because He is the all–sufficient God. He created everything and He can use anything He has created to fulfill any purpose. But you can provoke a desired harvest through your seed.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The Almighty God is the greatest seed–sower. When He gave His only begotten Son according to John 3:16, He was sowing a seed for eternal rewards. <b>We are God’s harvest for the seed which He sowed by offering Jesus Christ His Son to die on the cross.</b> God rejoices over His unending harvest of souls saved daily into His kingdom. We are a seed in God’s hand as well. When we yield our lives to God, we see the reward of a profitable life that brings glory to God through righteousness and commitment to the things of the kingdom. We can enjoy a life of speed of accomplishment through the seed principle. When your life becomes a seed in God’s hand, He becomes your harvest (Genesis 15:1). Rejoice in the Lord.
