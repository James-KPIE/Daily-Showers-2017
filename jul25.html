            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Luke 18:1-8</h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Heb. 11:6</strong> <br>                         
But without faith it is 
impossible to please him: 
for he that cometh to 
God must believe that he 
is, and that he is a 
rewarder of them that 
diligently seek him.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				Without faith it is impossible to actualize our heritage in Christ. The heritage of wholeness is still fresh in our memory. Both healing and wholeness are also obtainable by faith. Jesus Christ told several people whom he healed that it was their faith that made them whole (Matthew 9:22, 29). What we understand to be our heritage in Christ is obtainable through faith.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We are the righteousness of God through Christ by faith. Our belief in the efficacy of the blood of Jesus to wash our sins away and to save us from sin automatically obtains salvation for us. People who cannot simply tell that truth of the gospel, will simply remain unsaved. Millions of people are unsaved today, not because they have not heard the gospel but their intellectual arguments have kept them away from the simplicity of faith. Many of them quarrel with the truth that Jesus is the Son of God. They argue that God has no son. That has been the religious blindness which many people suffer from and which has kept their souls away from the One who could save them and give them eternal life. The Bible tells us of God in three–persons. He can manifest as God the Father or as God the Son or as God the Holy Spirit. He does not ask us to think it out. <b>We are only to believe His word and begin to enjoy His wonders.</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Every blessing of the scripture is to be received by faith. Victory over all kinds of enemies can be received through faith. In 1 John 5:4, it is by faith that we overcome whatever battle or adversity we face in this world. That is why we need to grow our faith. The word of God is the source of our faith and our faith can only grow as we study the word and allow the word to dwell in us richly. Our faith will become weak if we neglect the word of God. We also grow our faith as we listen to the testimonies of the Lord’s great doings. Many people received their own miracles as they listened to other people’s testimonies and their faith came alive.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Don’t be satisfied with a life that stagnates. Search through the word of God and locate your heritage in Christ. Then inject faith into the living word to generate living proofs for yourself. <b>When your faith is active, you will live a life of no limits.</b> Rejoice in the Lord.
