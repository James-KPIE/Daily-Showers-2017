            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Acts 5:16</strong> <br>                         
There came
also a multitude out
of the cities round
about unto
Jerusalem, bringing
sick folks, and them
which were vexed
with unclean spirits:
and they were healed
every one.</code></pre>

				The disciples who received the power of the Holy Spirit in the upper room went about demonstrating same in the course of ministering salvation and deliverance to the unsaved. Their exploits are summarized in our memory verse for today. We shall look at a few of the Apostles and how they demonstrated the power of the Holy Spirit.
				
				<br /><br />
				In Acts 5:15, Peter was so heavy under the anointing that his shadow was healing the sick. That was a dimension of healing that fulfilled the words of our Lord Jesus Christ in John 14:12. This was the same Peter who was unstable in the spirit when he was with our Lord Jesus Christ. In Matthew 16, he demonstrated spiritual understanding when he gave the revelation of the person of our Lord Jesus and the Master commended him. Later in the same chapter, fleshly emotion overtook his spiritual judgment when he objected to Christ talking about His crucifixion. Jesus Christ instantly rebuked him. Again, on the night when our Lord was crucified, he denied Him three times despite specific and clear warnings from our Lord Jesus. Yet, this same Peter was mightily baptized by the Holy Spirit and he became a terror to the kingdom of darkness.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				In Acts 8:5-8, Philip, one of the deacons who were appointed to serve the table was equally baptized by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit made no distinction between the deacons and the apostles. It was the same power given to all disciples to accomplish the same purpose in the kingdom. By the power of the Holy Spirit Philip was led to minister salvation to the Ethiopian Eunuch and after the ministration he was caught away by the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit moved through the same Philip, he preached the gospel with power in a city and there were signs and wonders and the transformation of lives brought joy to that city.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Our last example is Stephen. He was one of the deacons who were filled with the Holy Spirit and with faith and with power and with wisdom. He was able to capture the historical background of our salvation from Abraham to Jesus Christ and He challenged the Jews who crucified Jesus. His boldness earned him death from the hands of the persecutors but he was filled with the Holy Spirit till his death. Just like the days of the apostles, the Holy Spirit is with us to give us power for kingdom exploits. Rejoice in the Lord.
