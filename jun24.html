            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: 1 Peter 3:1-6 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: 1 Pet. 3:6</strong> <br>                         
Even as Sara obeyed
Abraham, calling him
lord: whose
daughters ye are, as
long as ye do well,
and are not afraid with 
any amazement.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				Sometime ago, we looked at the covenant credentials of Abraham. One of them was that he respected his wife Sarah and in so doing, gave heed to her counsel, although it did not turn out well for them on the matter of Ishmael especially the circumstances surrounding his birth. However, Sarah’s character, being a humble
and submissive wife, must have won her husband’s heart such that her words were not despised by Abraham. The kind of attention which a woman gets from her husband depends on her attitude. If the woman is flippant with her domestic responsibilities and would not take good care of her husband, that may warrant some negative reactions from the husband because all of us have emotions and we are human. It is unrealistic to expect that spirituality will swallow up our emotions so that we will not naturally react to circumstances. That is why both parties must be careful at all times so as not to provoke one another unto wrath. There is no human being who cannot be offended.
				</p>
				
				<p>Divine intervention may be difficult for an insolent wife at some critical point in her life if she violates the injunction of the Lord which requires her to honour and respect her husband. The Bible specifically mentions the case of child-birth. The best which any woman will pray for is to travail and bring forth in the delivery room. It is not all the women that have entered the labour room that came out alive with their babies. We may not know the reasons for such a tragedy but it is wise for a wife to take care how she relates with her husband so that she does not come under a curse. Husbands are authority figures over their wives irrespective of their financial or social status. Therefore, the wife needs to be careful so as not to provoke the husband to curse her.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				God places the husband above the woman for care and comfort as we observed yesterday but the wife should always remember to behave in a way that the husband would praise her and continue to pray for her and her children. The reverse must be resisted through good behavior. Where there are challenges, the woman should pray for more grace so that her reaction does not hinder God from intervening on the day of difficulty. Rejoice in the Lord.
