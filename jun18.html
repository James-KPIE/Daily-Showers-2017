            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: I King 8:57</strong> <br>                         
The LORD our God
be with us, as he was
with our fathers: let
him not leave us,
nor forsake us:</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				Great fathers are responsible fathers and we salute such fathers all over the world today. Abraham was commended by God in Genesis 18:19 because God saw in his heart a commitment to the affairs of his family especially to the training of his children. Little
wonder he was able to raise Isaac as an obedient boy who grew up to become very successful in business and transferred the legacy of hardwork to his own children as well. God wants to trust all fathers as he trusted Abraham.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The first responsibility of the father is to provide leadership in the home and the first area of that leadership is the fellowship at the altar. A responsible father leads the family to worship God from time to time. If the father is spiritual enough, he receives divine direction for the family as well. A father who is spirit-filled can lead his family by revelation. He can also be a pointer to the spiritual heights to which both his wife and children should aspire. A well rooted father in Christ should be able to say ‘thus saith the Lord’, to his family. I have had prayer directions for my family that brought a miracle which we cannot forget. When you know God’s purpose for each member of your family, time and resources will not be wasted. If there is one family that I want to emulate in the Bible, it is the family of Zachariah and Elizabeth. The father, mother and son were all filled with the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:41, 67 and 80). One of our greatest moments in my family was when the children came back from the camp and some of them were filled with the Holy Spirit. It brought us so much joy.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The second responsibility of the father is to see to the welfare of the family. It is incumbent on the father to work hard in the spirit of Ecclesiastes 9:10 in order to take care of his family. This is a core issue of faith. That is why the scripture says that failure of a father to do this is a denial of his faith in Christ. This aspect of a father’s assignment is worth praying and seeking the face of the Lord for that it shall be a fulfillment. My constant prayer for fathers is that God will give to them what it takes to be a husband over their wives and a father over their children. Are you already a father or an aspiring father? Begin to pray that prayer. Mothers and children should pray the prayer for their husbands and fathers. Rejoice in the Lord.
