If thou doest well, shalt
thou not be accepted?
and if thou doest not
well, sin lieth at the door.
And unto thee shall be
his desire, and thou
shalt rule over
him.</code></pre>

				A wise man once said that those who always find someone to blame for their woes always end up lame. Each of us is responsible for what he or she becomes in life and where we end our spiritual journey-whether in heaven or in hell. And there is no boarder line. It is appointed unto every man to face judgment at the end of his life if he refuses to take advantage of the salvation which Jesus has freely offered. Those who have accepted the free gift of salvation through Christ will not face
judgment. However, everyone who rejects Jesus Christ shall be judged. The final judgment is based on the score-card of each one. For every believer, the work we did shall be tested by fire. There will be weeping at that time if our work does not pass the test of fire. That is why the time to work out our salvation, the accepted time is now. Whoever fails to do it right at this time will not have any time for amendment or adjustment on the last day.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Each of us has to be self-accountable in order to live a life that is above board. We cannot pass the buck for our sin to anyone. No person is responsible for our iniquities or transgression. Abel was not responsible for the woes of Cain. Each one brought an offering according to his discretion. Cain brought just anyone among his harvest but Abel brought the first fruit. It was a question of how each of them placed God. Many people don’t make God and the matter of His kingdom a priority in their lives. They don’t understand that their tithe should be the first tax on their income. They did not know that through the tithe they acknowledge God as their source. Indeed, many people think that their employment or their boss or their working husband is their source. No. Institutions or people could be used as channels to bless you but only God is your source. So, Cain missed it and when his offering was rejected as the Lord has no respect of his person as well, he grew annoyed and transferred his aggression to his brother and despite God’s timely warning he committed the first murder in the Bible. He ended up sadly.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Who would you blame if you fail at the end? Your wife? I have heard of some unserious fellows who attend church, that they justify their adulterous relationships because of the actions of their wives. I asked whether they will say that to God on the judgment day. You will have only yourself to blame on the last day, not anyone else. Shape up now, turn to Christ and remain in Him. It shall be well with you on the last day. Rejoice in the Lord.
