            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Isa. 9:6</strong> <br>                         
For unto us a child is born, 
unto us a son is given: and 
the government shall be upon 
his shoulder: and his name 
shall be called Wonderful, 
Counsellor, The mighty God, 
The everlasting Father, The 
Prince of Peace.</code></pre>

				The personality of our Lord Jesus Christ is a mystery. He was conceived of the Holy Spirit in the womb of Mary as a Child. However, He was sent by God as His beloved Son to save the world from sin. Jesus Christ came as a child to express His humanity. Yet, His sonship defines His divinity. This could further be explained in the sense that He is Jesus as a man but He is Christ as the Spirit-being-the Anointed One. Jesus Christ needed His humanity to feel what we feel. He needed to feel the pains which He saved us from feeling if we had face the
consequences of our sin. Thank God that He sent His only begotten Son to come to the world to bear the wrath for our sin.
				</p>

				No sinner can deliver a fellow sinner from sin. A man who falls into a well would need someone who is outside the well to pull him out. Our Lord Jesus was sinless since He did not come by the seed of man. Rather, He came by the seed of the word and that is why one of His names is the Word (John 1:1). Jesus Christ is the Word that was with God in the beginning. No one could stand in the place of Jesus Christ. The angels could not do what He came to do because angels could sin. Satan was an angel who used to lead the choir in heaven until he fell through pride. Only our Lord Jesus Christ was qualified to come as a sinless person to bear the punishment for the sins of the sinful man.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				To all the people in the world who are celebrating Jesus Christ today there are some critical issues that we must consider in order to appreciate the reason why Jesus Christ came. The first is that every person who is born into this world is born into sin and he or she is helpless as to how to handle the problem of sin. Education cannot handle it neither is there any philosophy that could handle sin. Sin is the greatest form of bondage. Jesus Christ told the Jews this truth in John 8:34 but they could not understand. Today, billions of people are roaming in sin all over the world and they will never be able to overcome sin except they believe in Jesus Christ and receive the cleansing blood for the washing of their sins. You don’t need to have a catalogue of sins before you become a sinner. The truth is that you are a sinner by nature until Jesus Christ washes your sins away by His blood. Accept Him today and He will set you free from sin. Rejoice in the Lord.
