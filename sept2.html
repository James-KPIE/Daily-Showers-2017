How God anointed Jesus of 
Nazareth with the Holy Ghost 
and with power: who went 
about doing good, and healing 
all that were oppressed of 
the devil; for God was 
with him.</code></pre>

				<p>Our Lord Jesus impacted the disciples when they were with Him and the impact of His ministry has been felt all over the world since then. As we observed few weeks ago, the leadership style of Jesus was such that allowed His disciples not only to witness the wonders and the miracles He did, but He called them, trained them and empowered them to do even more than He did when He was physically present on the earth. When He was about to return to the Father, He sent the Holy Spirit to take over so that the empowerment continued.
He specifically told us in Acts 1:8 that we shall receive power through the baptism of the Holy Spirit. He introduced the Holy Spirit to us as the Counsellor, the Teacher and the Comforter. He is the Spirit of truth who guides us away from errors. And the Holy Spirit has been with the church ever since, doing through the disciples of Jesus Christ the same works He did before He returned to the Father. Our Lord Jesus Christ left for us the legacy of impact and desires that we do so too.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				It is incumbent on us, therefore, to put narrow and selfish motives aside in the course of doing ministry. The ministry is not about us but about the owner of the business who, in His mercy and magnanimity, has co-opted us into the ministry of reconciliation and made us co–workers with Him according to 1 Corinthians 3:9. It is all about Jesus Christ who laid down His life that we all might be saved from the wrath of sin. We are well equipped to generate impact and continue the work of kingdom expansion if we follow the instructions of the Master. If we remain in unity, we can easily facilitate the flow of the anointing from the Holy Spirit. God is so gracious to His church that we don’t need a multitude of people before He can show up in our midst. Once we can break through the barriers of disunity and abide in holiness, God is ready to work in our midst when we put faith into action.
				</p>
				
				<p>	
We must do everything to preserve the ministry of impact. We must not be satisfied with being blessed but we should seek to be a blessing at all times. That is the surest way to be impactful. We need to seek the Lord’s face continually and open our hearts to Him to lead us in the way we shall go in order to make maximum impact. Our impact should last beyond our lifetime. That is God’s pattern for us. Rejoice in the Lord.
