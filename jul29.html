				<b>When heaven approves you, the earth must applaud you.</b> This is one fallout of divine favour. We can also safely conclude that when heaven approves you for favour, you shine everywhere. We observed yesterday that to be favoured is one of the manifestations of God’s glory upon a man. It was not strange, therefore, to hear Joseph instructing his brothers in
Genesis 45:8 to tell Jacob his father of all his (Joseph’s) glory in Egypt. When the brothers of Joseph were planning to sell him, little did they know that they were pushing him closer to his glory. Joseph came to Egypt as a slave but the favour of God rested upon him.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				No sooner had Joseph settled down in Portiphar’s house than the master began to notice certain unique characteristics in him; Joseph was not downcast and he was in his best element. He was alert, dutiful and responsible; in addition–there was the visible presence of God around him which made him do his work in most unique ways, getting results where other people would fail. This uniqueness made his master to make him the head of his domestic administration. The excellence in Joseph just shone effortlessly. <b>He could not be ignored because he was so good at what he did.</b> Whatever Joseph did must have enjoyed divine assistance because he was never in that kind of employment before. Yet, he was exceptional in performance to the admiration of his master. The elevation that Joseph enjoyed would have been beyond contemplation for anyone in the status of a slave. Favour can cause a downgraded fellow to be lifted in honour.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Favour is indeed the product of divine approval. When God approves you, you will enjoy sweatless triumph. Men will see your light and run into it. Favour is the practical fulfillment of the prophecy in Isaiah 60:3 which says that Gentiles will come to your light. Portiphar could not ignore the light that shone upon Joseph neither could he belittle the light. The light of a favoured child of God cannot be quenched just as his glory cannot be covered. That is why we must always seek God’s approval rather than the approval of men. No man can give you what God can give, but when God approves you, men will compete to bless you. Rejoice in the Lord.
