            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Ps. 1:3</strong> <br>                         
And he shall be like a tree 
planted by the rivers of 
water, that bringeth forth 
his fruit in his season; his 
leaf also shall not wither; 
and whatsoever he doeth 
shall prosper.</code></pre>

				Many of us encounter success in the things that we do as professionals and in our careers, in our studies and the business place because of the good hand of the Lord which has been upon us. These are expressions of the heritage of success which we have in Christ. Grace gives us enablement to do better or much more easier what used to be difficult for us. Every Christian who will accept the responsibility to obey God and
follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit is on the path of success. God has taken on the responsibility to make us successful. In Isaiah 48:17, He declares that He is the God that teaches us to profit, that is, to be successful and prosper in all that we do. I am yet to see a man fail under divine guidance. When the Lord guides you, you will surely succeed.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Joseph was hooked up to God as a young man and the Lord continued to make a marvellous show of him wherever he went, notwithstanding the status which opposition and oppression put on him. That is why the Excellency of God showed in him both as a slave and as a prisoner. He was unstoppable and his results were undeniable. The work of his hands spoke for him and his masters respected him because results command respect. Joseph’s promotion could not be hindered because there is no discrimination against excellence. Joseph succeeded in all that he did.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The Bible shows us that the secret of the success which Joseph had was divine presence. The Lord was with him. A man who enjoys divine presence will doubtlessly, enjoy divine partnership. When God becomes the senior partner in the business you are doing, your success becomes inevitable. An American Christian started a business with five hundred dollars many years ago. He invited God into the business and covenanted with God to give 90% of the profit while he would keep 10%. In five years, that business was worth fifty million dollars. At the Kenneth Hagins camp meeting in 1979, he told a congregation of seventeen thousand people to give the best offering they could give after which he and his wife would double it. When the seventeen thousand brethren gave three million dollars as their offering, he rose up at the podium and said <blockquote>“Brethren, is that all you can do?”</blockquote> You have the heritage of success in Christ. Partner with Him today. Rejoice in the Lord.
