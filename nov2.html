            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Rom. 8:5-14 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Rom. 8:6</strong> <br>                         
For to be carnally minded is 
death; but to be spiritually 
minded is life and peace.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>The mind of Christ is a mind at rest; therefore it is a mind which dwells in peace. In redemption, we are reconciled with God. Until we were saved we were distant from God because we were sinners. Jesus Christ went to the cross to perfect the work for our salvation. Those who put their faith in the redemptive work of Christ are restored from eternal condemnation.
				<br /><br />
				The first thing a person experiences when he is saved is the inner peace that the joy of salvation brings. We receive rest from inner struggles and the condemnation which are the lot of a person who runs errands for the devil. Paul the apostle was once a persecutor of the church of Jesus Christ. He was a tool in the hand of the devil who sent him wherever to inflict bodily harms on those who belong to the Way. He was there when Stephen was being stoned to death, approving and encouraging those who assassinated that beloved servant of the Lord. However, when Jesus Christ met him and confronted him on the way to Damascus, he surrendered his life to Christ and he was reconciled with God from whom he had been alienated until Christ met him. From then on, he became an apostle of Jesus Christ preaching repentance and conversion to sinners so they may have peace with God.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The mind of Jesus Christ is at peace and that is why we can draw peace from Him. In Matthew 11:28-29, He beckons to all men to come unto Him, especially those that are in pains of labour and are under the heavy yokes from Satan. Jesus Christ is the prince of peace. He came to this earth to offer peace to those whose lives are in turmoil, to those who live in uncertainty. You see, many people go to church today and they don’t enjoy the peace for which Jesus Christ suffered and died on the cross. Isaiah 53:4 says that the chastisement of our peace was upon Him. He paid the price for our peace.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We have peace in Christ because those of us who are saved no longer live in uncertainty. The truth which the gospel has made us to know creates the awareness of God’s peace which has been made available for us. We are certain that we will spend eternity in heaven, so we are no longer moved by the suffering and persecutions which we may face here on the earth. We have peace and we are of good cheer for Jesus Christ has given us victory. We are justified by His death so we have peace rather than the feeling of guilt for our pre-conversion misdeeds. We have peace because of the precious promises which are our heritage in Christ. We have peace because Jesus has provided succor for us in all our difficulties. Rejoice in the Lord.
