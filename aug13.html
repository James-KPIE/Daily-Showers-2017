And they departed

that they were
counted worthy
to suffer shame
for his name.</code></pre>

				<p>
				Have you ever suffered shame or torture for your faith in Christ/ have you suffered the loss of someone or something precious because of the violence and terror of the agents of anti-Christ? You are the one to whom God is sending this message today. Christianity at this end-time can no longer be the usual bread and butter Christianity. It is time to expect the
best and prepare for the worst. If you think otherwise, then you are deceiving yourself. The words of our Lord Jesus Christ concerning the end-time are being fulfilled. Whichever way the persecution or the end-time suffering may come, we need to get ready. If you don’t get ready, you may easily deny Christ at the slight appearance of any confrontation that requires you to surrender. When the calamities come, it will not be the time to ask God why.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The apostles have set the example for us to follow. They already knew Jesus and inspite of all the beatings and the persecution, they remained stubbornly committed to the spreading of the gospel. Thank God for the power of the Holy Spirit which they had received. If not for the Holy Spirit, what would Peter have done? If he denied knowing Jesus before an ordinary housemaid, what would he do when guns and other weapons are pointed at him? We all need to ask for the fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit. Without the in-filling of the Holy Spirit, no one can be on fire for Christ at this end-time. Some of us are comfortable now because we dwell in areas which are considered safe. What if where you are today becomes unsafe tomorrow and you find yourself right in the midst of persecution and destruction? This may be the time to pray for strength and courage to endure rather than for security only.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Each of us must pray himself into the agenda of God for the end-time. Our prayers must be more violent and this may not be the time to pray for butter and bread. Pray for your family, that whatever may happen at this end-time, none of you will lose your soul. Pray that the wind of the end-time will not blow you away from the track of salvation. Pray, pray and pray. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
