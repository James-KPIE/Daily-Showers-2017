            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Esther 7:1-10 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: 1 Sam. 17:51</strong> <br>                         
Therefore David ran, and 
stood upon the Philistine, 
and took his sword, and 
drew it out of the sheath 
thereof, and slew him, and 
cut off his head therewith. 
And when the Philistines 
saw their champion was 
dead, they fled.</code></pre>

				Our God is awesome He works out the deliverance of His children. We can recollect how He gave victory and deliverance to the people of Judah during the reign of Jehoshaphat when singers filed out, praising God as they faced a multinational army that had come to attack the nation. The people of Judah had no weapons of war, yet God gave victory to His people. In Proverbs 21:31, the Bible says: <blockquote>“The horse may be prepared for the day of battle, but victory is of the Lord.”</blockquote>
				<br /><br />
				The Lord never left His people to their own strength whenever they faced the enemy in a battle. On the contrary, the Lord would move in a supernatural way to fight for His people and give them victory. It is instructive to note that the Bible also says that we cannot prevail by our strength (1Samuel 2:9). God was angry with David in 2 Samuel 24 when he embarked on the census of Israel and Judah because He had never delivered Israel from their enemies by the strength of their army or the power of their weapons. God always fought the battles for Israel.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The Lord also gave victory to His people by using the instrument of the enemies to destroy those enemies. In 1 Samuel 17, Goliath engaged the army of Israel for forty days, threatening and intimidating them. Then David came to the scene and got victory for Israel using his sling and stone. In order to be sure that Goliath rose no more, David took the sword of Goliath which fell from his hand and cut off his head. That was how the victory over Goliath became total and permanent. The Lord also gave victory to Mordecai and the Jews when the king ordered that Haman be hanged in the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai.
				</p>
				
				<p>	
The Lord can also use the enemies’ food and other supplies to enrich His own people as a means of demonstrating His power to seal the victory He has given to His people. In 2 Kings 7, the Lord sent away the Aramean army by making them to hear strange sounds of chariots, horses and a large army. They left in their camp food, water, silver, gold, and clothes which the lepers and the people of Samaria took over as the spoil of war which they never really fought because the Lord fought for them. What a way to transfer wealth to God’s people too. Rejoice in the Lord.
