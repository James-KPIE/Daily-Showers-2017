            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Mk. 5:6</strong> <br>                         

But when he saw Jesus 
afar off, he ran and 
worshipped him,</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				The story of the madman of Gadara is an amazement. It was one of those cases in the Bible where God’s mercy and help located a man whose destiny had been written off. In most cases, we see madmen as having got to the end of a good life. They are abandoned and even family members keep away from them. But
grace located the madman when Jesus went his way where he was tormented by a legion of demons. May God locate you with your miracle wherever you are today. The stories of Moses, David and the widow of Zarephat were similar. There is more to learn from the case of the madman of Gadara.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The madman was so famous that he was identified by the name of a city. On the day that his miracle came, he did what many normal people will consider themselves too dignified to do. As this madman sighted Jesus, the Bible says he fell down and worshipped Him. It could be explained that the demons in him sensed a higher Spirit and bowed to the higher power, But much more than that, it takes the inspiring power of grace for that man to kneel before Jesus and worship. When the grace of God wants to bring a blessing your way, particularly a unique blessing, this grace will motivate you to do an unusual thing, something uncommon. When you do that, you will then experience an amazing blessing which may become the talk of the people in your immediate environment. When they listen to your story, they will conclude that your testimony came as a result of the uncommon step you took which provoked divine manifestation in the order in which it occurred.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Worship is a gateway to miraculous blessings and victories. Those who take it to heart to worship God at all times are qualified for amazing healings, deliverance, liftings, turnarounds and open doors. David was a committed worshipper of God even when he was in the far away desert. Read Psalm 18:1-2 and see David’s way of worship whenever he got onto the platform of worship. Worship was a personalized issue between David and God. In his hours of worship, David’s expression of deep worship centred on who God was to him. Little wonder he experienced divine intervention that culminated in victory time and again. Let us take our worship to a higher level and greater shall be the testimonies that will follow. Rejoice in the Lord.
