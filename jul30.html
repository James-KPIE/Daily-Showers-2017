            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Genesis 26:6-16 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Gen. 26:16</strong> <br>                         
And Abimelech said unto 
Isaac, Go from us; for 
thou art much mightier 
than we.</code></pre>

				No power can stop the prosperity of the beloved of the Lord who is riding in favour. And it does not matter where he dwells on the surface of the earth, the hand of the Lord will support him and prosper him. Ezra enjoyed the favour of God as a captive leader in Persia much so that king Darius gave the order to
support the project of rebuilding the temple in Jerusalem with royal resources. Ezra attributed the favours to the good hand of the Lord that was upon him. Nehemiah also had tremendous favour with king Artaxerxes so that the king granted all the requests he made as he led the team of the captives who went to rebuild the fallen walls of Jerusalem. Favour prospers a child of God both at home and aboard.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Isaac’s case was peculiar. He dwelt in Gerar because the Lord promised to be with him there. His business suffered a serious setback due to the attacks from the people who were the natives in that land, but he kept the promise of the Lord close to his chest and kept working until he wearied his adversaries. The more the enemies attacked his business, the more Isaac prospered. The entire nation envied one single man who was operating under divine favour.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The prosperity of a favoured child of God cannot be stopped. When a man is favoured by God, the Almighty God dispatches His angels to help him. It does not matter whether there is a famine in the land just as it was while Isaac dwelt in Gerar. The God–factor always makes the difference because the favoured person enjoys supernatural back up. The favour of the Lord gives the child of God rest when the enemies are on the offensive. Isaac did not shift focus because the Lord turned the adversities to advancement for him. Moreover, he did not give up. We are not the ones to give up in the face of opposition. We must always recall the strong declaration of the psalmist according to Psalm 46:7 and 11 and make it our confession day and night. It says; “The Lord of hosts is with us and the God of Jacob is our refuge.” It works. It pays to assure yourself of the presence of God which He has promised us at all times. He has promised us His presence and His help and He always keeps His word. His favour will prosper you both at home and abroad. Rejoice in the Lord.
