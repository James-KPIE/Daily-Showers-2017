            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Matt. 10:8</strong> <br>                         
Heal the sick, cleanse the 
lepers, raise the dead, cast 
out devils: freely ye have 
received, freely give.</code></pre>

				We shall draw the curtain on how God provides permanent solution to problems, today, by turning attention to ourselves. I have stated in the course of writing on this subject that God’s nature is to solve problems. And that should be true of the nature of those who share His nature, that is, the born again child of God. One of the radical
changes we experience through salvation is love, agape love. This is the unconditional, selfless, others–centred love which makes one to wish the other fellow well, care for the other person and think good about that fellow. This kind of love seeks the good interest of other people and would go the extra mile to find solution to the challenges which other people may face. Agape love is a giving love and the foundation for that love in us is found in John 3:16. The Lord loves the world and, as a result, He gave His holy Son to die so that through His death, He will solve the problem of sin which is the greatest problem of mankind.
				<br /><br />
				When Jesus Christ came, He went all out solving problems. We can hardly find anything Jesus Christ did for Himself. Day after day, He went out healing the sick, delivering the oppressed, giving food to the hungry and setting the captives free. He gave His time to do all those things and when He had given everything, He gave His life for us all so that through Him, we may have eternal life. Just as Jesus Christ our Lord came to solve problems, so we are sent to the world as His disciples to solve problems. This becomes our task as long as we live.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The first way to demonstrate that we are followers of Christ in solving problems is to seek the salvation of the lost. The sinner is lost in sin and he or she is on the way to hell. As soon as we are saved, the compassion of Jesus which is instantly transmitted into us makes us desire to help the sinner find his Saviour and Jesus Christ is the Saviour. Therefore, we labour in prayers and we persuade men and women to accept the provision which Jesus has made for their salvation.
				</p>
				
				<p>	
We also receive the Holy Spirit after we have been saved and He dwells in us to make us Christlike and to empower us to be fruitful. Through the indwelling power of the Holy Spirit, we become wise because Jesus Christ is the power and wisdom of God. Through the wisdom of God we can provide solutions to problems in every area of life and we can help people out of their daily challenges. It is the wisdom of God in us that enables us to be useful to our world as problem solvers. Rejoice in the Lord.
