            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: John 4:19-30 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: John 4:29</strong> <br>                         
Come, see a man,
which told me all
things that ever I did:
is not this the Christ?</code></pre>

				<p>
				We are saved to make it into heaven ultimately but between the time of our salvation and when we shall see God in glory, we can make a great impact for the kingdom by telling other people about the One who saved our soul. This is what we call evangelism. Every born again child of God is
automatically an evangelist. You don’t need to wait for any formal appointment by the church. The Samaritan woman who encountered Jesus ran into the city to call people to come and see Jesus. She was unselfish. She believed that other people could also encounter God because she had experienced God through the Prophet. In Mark 5:20 the Bible says that the mad man who was healed departed and began to publish it in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him, and all men did marvel. That is what we are required to do after we are saved.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				In Psalm 66:16 the Psalmist said: ‘Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what He hath done for my soul.” One of the ways of multiplying your testimonies is by sharing them. Every testimony is a prophecy. When you declare one, you have unconsciously provoked heaven to do more. The testimony that you share also gives you an upper hand against the adversary because you have published your victory over the enemy in the area in which you shared your testimony. In other words, if you testify of healing, that is victory over the power that wants to tie you down through sickness.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Every believer is raised as a publisher of the goodnews just like the Samaritan woman and the mad-man of Gadara. To publish the good news should be just as easy as merely conversing with anybody. You can bring Jesus into any conversation you are having with anyone. In Jesus Christ is life and He is Life to all men. He is the One who teaches us to profit (Isaiah 48:17). He is the One who causes us to succeed (Psalm 1:3). If it is a family matter, God is a family man. That is why our Lord’s prayer begins with ‘Our Father who art in heaven’ instead of ‘Our God who art in heaven.’ Jesus is relevant in every area of our lives so you can bring Him into every conversation. Don’t forget this. Rejoice in the Lord.
