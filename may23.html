And when he came to the den, 
he cried with a lamentable 
voice unto Daniel: and the 
king spake and said to Daniel, 
O Daniel, servant of the 
living God, is thy God, whom 
thou servest continually, 
able to deliver thee from 
the lions?</code></pre>

				<p>
				As joyful as the true worship of God is, it may be costly for those who face persecution for daring to show to the world that they serve and worship the Almighty God. The case of Meshac, Shadrach and Abednego in Daniel chapter 3 makes it clear that if we are committed to worship God in spirit and in truth, we must be prepared to pay the inevitable price which may be demanded of us when persecution comes. Our Lord Jesus Christ warned us ahead of time that we shall face persecution as His disciples and followers. Those three Hebrew boys had to choose between the worship of idols and the fiery furnace but
they chose the latter. They told the king that they had made up their minds to worship the living God and that they were not ready to renounce their commitment. God followed them into the fiery furnace and the fire had no power over them. The servants of the king who threw the Hebrew boys into the furnace were slain by the heat of the furnace. They died as a ransom for the souls of those true servants of the Most High.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The case of Daniel was almost in the same fashion. A law was passed that no one should worship any other god but Daniel insisted on worshipping the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob–the covenant–keeping God. The whole thing was a set up against Daniel because he was a friend to the king, but the king could not but carry out the law which he had signed with his seal. All he could do was to wish Daniel divine protection and preservation as he was led to the lions’ den. The Lord answered the prayer of the king for Daniel and shut the mouths of those lions. In a practical application of divine law of substitution, the conspirators and their family members were fed to the lions the following morning after Daniel came out of the lions’ den alive.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				How far are we willing to go in our worship of God especially in this age of fierce persecution of believers all over the world? How many of us are ready to dare whatever may come because of our commitment to the worship of the only true God? What are we ready to give up rather than compromise the worship of the triune God? Let us make up our minds to worship the living God until we see Him in glory. No price is too high to pay. Rejoice in the Lord.
