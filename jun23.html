            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Eph. 5:25-33 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: 1 Pet. 3:7</strong> <br>                         
Likewise, ye husbands, dwell 
with them according to 
knowledge, giving honour unto 
the wife, as unto the weaker 
vessel, and as being heirs 
together of the grace of life; 
that your prayers be not hindered.</code></pre>

				<p>
				I want to touch an issue that some men will be uncomfortable with, today. However, I offer no apology because the word of God, rather than a man’s word is what I seek to share. Unless we humbly desire to receive the whole counsel of God through His inerrant word, we cannot maximize our destiny in Christ. There are certain things which we are urged by the Bible to do but which appear foolish to men and women who are wise in their own eyes. The word of God says that the foolishness of God is wiser than men. To
live a profitable and fruitful life in Christ requires that we receive God’s word with a humble heart. Jesus Christ is the lover of our soul. He loves us more than the enemy hates us and He has our best interest in focus through every word He has sent for our comfort and edification.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Each husband ought to deal wisely with his wife. The Bible describes the wife as a person to be gently handled. She was made in God’s image to be your helper. However, she is not perfect just as you too are not perfect. You cannot change her just as she cannot change you. Only God can do that and any attempt to do it by yourself will meet a brick wall. Therefore, it is wise for men to deal gently with their wives and keep on grooming them as they did at the beginning of their relationship. When we do so, God will deal compassionately with us too. God is above us just as we are above our wives. Our duty to treat them well is a covenant responsibility we owe to God just as they owe it a duty to God to submit to us. God’s word says if we harass and molest them, if we make life uncomfortable or unbearable for them, we may labour in vain in the theatre of prayers. Men who know that they need God in all they do will think twice before they treat their wives as slaves or turn them to punching bags.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Check out what you have been passing through. How is your business? Are things very hard for you? Are you laboring hard with little to show for it? Take a look at how you have been dealing with your wife under God. Have you been fair to her? Can she even truly bless you from her heart? Or she is quietly regretting being married to you? No one can answer those questions for you. If you have erred, repent and be humble enough to make amends. Let your wife see a change and God will restore your losses. Rejoice in the Lord.
