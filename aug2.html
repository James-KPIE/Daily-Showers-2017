            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Gen. 50:18-21 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Gen. 50:18</strong> <br>                         
And his brethren also
went and fell down
before his face; and
they said, Behold, we
be thy servants.</code></pre>

				<p>
We shall draw the curtain on the experience of Joseph under the subject of favour today. The summary of his experience is that a man who enjoys divine favour is unstoppable. That was why David was unstoppable. The father of David (Jesse) forgot him. His half brothers hated him. Bible history
has it that David was the only child of his mother among his father’s children. He did not enjoy the acceptance of his brothers who hated to see him in town. They openly resented him when he brought food to the camp for they, obviously, were among the harassed perplexed, overwhelmed and intimidated Israelites under the threat of Goliath for forty days. They did not know that he was their ‘saviour.’ Despite all the attempts which King Saul made to kill this young David, the favour of God preserved him until he got to the throne. At a time, he even had to spare King Saul’s life.				</p>
				
				<p>
We must all seek God’s favour through prayers. Can you imagine how effortlessly Joseph and David got to their thrones? No contest, no politics, no bribery, no outsmarting, no manipulating, no godfather. God rose as God and Father to these two young fellows and shot them up right to the throne. How great is our God! When you enjoy divine favour, you will not be engaged in the rat race of this world. <b>When you run a company which is covenanted to God, you will not need to go the way of the world to have a place in the market. You can relax and run your business with sound, Bible based, moral ethics without fear in this corrupt and perverted world.</b>				</p>
				
				<p>
We must note, however, that walking under favour compels us to be active in faith and to stand in combat rather than sink in our comfort zone. Joseph was highly favoured but he stayed righteous by faith. If he had given in to sin, he would have lost his eventual throne. Samson was highly favoured under the anointing of God but he ended up wasting his future because of sin by careless indulgence. David moved from combat to combat while lesser battles prepared him for greater ones. When you know that you are favoured by the Almighty God, then you must accept the responsibility to be holy and sanctified unto Him so that the channel of your favour might not be blocked. As long as you abide under the righteousness of Christ, favour will continue to find expression in your life and you will be unstoppable, just as Joseph was unstoppable. Rejoice in the Lord.				</p>
