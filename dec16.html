            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Matthew 25:14-24 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Rom. 11:36</strong> <br>                         
For of him, and through him, 
and to him, are all things: 
to whom be glory for ever. 
Amen.</code></pre>

				<p>
				The same principle of the usage of our treasure as we considered yesterday holds for our divine endowments and those abilities that are peculiar to each of us in their application or usage. I have heard some
people who don’t fear God saying they can do whatever they like with their bodies. However, that is foolishness because each of us will give account to the Lord on what we do in the body. We are earthen vessels with treasures embedded inside of us. We have individual talents which many of us have exploited to make wealth. Some of us have grown so proud as a result of our accomplishments in many areas particularly in sports and in the entertainment industry. Unfortunately some Christians who discovered their ability to sing have lost their salvation because they left the kingdom and went to the world to exhibit such talents and were trapped in the process. Immorality has overtaken some of those who were chaste and pure in the process of marketing and exhibiting their talents.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We owe God an explanation for how we apply our talents and even the gifts of the Holy Spirit which are given to the church for the profiting of the body of Christ. Do we become lords over our brethren because the Holy Spirit allows us to express His gift of healing or miracles? Do we seek promotion in the church because we find God using us in a certain way in which He does not use other people around us? Are we now unreachable as pastors or leaders because of the influence of the Holy Spirit in our ministry? The talents and gifts of God in our lives are not meant to make us proud. Rather they are to make us humble if we understand the person of our Lord Jesus Christ whose disciples we are and whose life we should emulate. Read Philippians 2:5-9 again and you will be sober.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We must not throw caution into the winds when we find ourselves excelling in any particularly area. We should always remember that Satan was the choir leader in heaven before he fell due to pride. God can do without any of us and none of us can get God stranded. If we remember that it is God who makes us what we are we will become wise and be humble. Without you and I this world will go on. We are all in a passage of time and how we use our talents and our gifts will determine what we shall be remembered for. May we not allow pride to consume us and may we continually return all glory to God for all He has endowed us with in life and in the ministry. Rejoice in the Lord.
