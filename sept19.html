          <h1>WATER FROM THE ROCK?</h1>

            <h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>
            <h4 align="right">Tue. Sept. 19, 2017</h4>
            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Exodus 17:1-7 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Exo. 17:6</strong> <br>                         
Behold, I will stand before 
thee there upon the rock in 
Horeb; and thou shalt smite 
the rock, and there shall 
come water out of it, that 
the people may drink. And 
Moses did so in the sight 
of the elders of Israel.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				It is not natural to look for water in the rock just as it would be a foolish thing to expect bread and meat from the bird called raven, but our God is the unlimited God. We are limited in power, in knowledge, infact in everything. God is unlimited in all things. He lives forever so He is not limited by time. He is the omniscient God so He is not limited in knowledge. He is the omnipotent God so is He is not limited in power. He is the omnipresent God so He is not limited in space. It works well for us that God is who He is and His very nature is a big advantage to citizens of the kingdom.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				God did miracles after miracle for the children of Israel. After they had crossed the red sea, the Israelites got the place where the water was bitter and God provided a solution as He directed His servant Moses to cut a branch of a particular tree which he threw inside the water and it became sweet. Now they got to the place where there was no water and they needed a miracle. Naturally, one would expect water to flow in the valley or that rain would fall from the sky. However, our unlimited God chose to show, once more, His very nature to the Israelites. He instructed Moses to strike the rock with the rod of wonders and there was water gushing out of the rock, more than sufficient for the Israelites to drink. They were wonderfully refreshed.
				</p>
				
				<p>	
Beloved, these miracles are to boost our faith to believe God in all situations. A wise man once said that no door is closed when your mind is open. You cannot shut out on God in any area of your life. It does not matter what the report is or what the circumstances appear to be. I heard a testimony recently of a lady whose pregnancy was to be flushed out because the doctors confirmed that the baby inside her womb was dead. Meanwhile, she had been looking unto the Lord for a baby boy. While sorrowing over the report, a man of God saw her and asked why she was downcast. Then she told her story. As the man of God laid his hand on the womb to pray, the baby jumped back to life. By the time the testimony was shared, the baby who had become a young man had finished his master’s degree programme in the university. Our God can do anything.				
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Are you trusting God today in a difficult situation? Solution can come from unlikely quarters in an unlikely manner because God cannot be limited. Celebrate His reliability. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
