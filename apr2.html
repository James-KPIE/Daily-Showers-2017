Being justified freely by his

					Thank God for the little exposition which the Holy Spirit enabled us to do yesterday. At least, it will help the legalistic Christians to know that they need not struggle with God by making efforts to make right their sinful past deeds. There are people who believe
that they have to work to earn the forgiveness of their sins and obtain the righteousness of God so as to be perfect with Him. That would mean that grace has been excluded. The work of grace made Jesus pay the price for sin. This was to free us from its guilt as we put our faith in the perfect work which Jesus did, to set us free from the bondage of guilt and punishment for sin.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					You may recall that certain people had asked Jesus in John 6:28 what they should do to work the works of God. The answer which our Lord Jesus Christ gave must have shocked them. Jesus told them that the only work they needed to do was to believe on whom the Father had sent. Confused, they asked for the sign He would show them that they may believe Him. Our Lord Jesus then compared Himself to the manna which Moses gave to their fathers in the wilderness. He told them He was the bread of God that came down from heaven which the Father had given to the world. Just like many people in our own day, the natural man wants to see his righteousness emanate from what he can do. Jesus Christ, who is the personification of grace, would have us turn from ourselves to the cross to behold the work which Christ has done for our salvation. We can only receive forgiveness and justification by the work which Jesus Christ accomplished on the cross. All we need do is believe in what He did, appropriate it for our justification and our righteousness and enjoy the peace which Jesus Christ has restored on the cross.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Only one price needed to be paid for the sin of man which we all inherited from Adam. As we read yesterday, one man had sinned and tainted the whole humanity with sin. In Adam, all have sinned and come short of the glory of God through the loss of the divine nature. Blessed be God that Jesus Christ, having paid the price which the punishment for sin demanded, has made those who believe in Him to be reconciled to the Father and now share in His divine nature through Christ (2 Peter 2:4). Rejoice in the Lord.
