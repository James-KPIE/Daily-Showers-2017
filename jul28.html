            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Daniel 1:1-9 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Dan. 1:9</strong> <br>                         
Now God had brought Daniel 
into favour and tender 
love with the prince of 
the eunuchs.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				The favour of God makes you to shine. God’s favour is an output of the glory of God. When a man or a woman carries the glory of God, as Daniel did, favour is inevitable. That is why we must live holy, consecrated lives unto God. When your life is
pleasing unto God, He causes men and women to have delight in blessing you without knowing why. When you operate under divine favour, you will not need to beg men for anything because God’s favour begins to find what you need. When it locates it in the hands of a person, the Spirit of God who recognizes and executes favour causes that person to give it to you. He is the Spirit that overturns all things until it gets to whom He chooses.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Ever wondered how a captive girl like Esther could become a queen in a strange land, where she was a stranger? That is God’s favour working in the order of Ezekiel 21:27. I met a lady lawyer who had wanted to become a Judge in her office some years ago. I asked and she said ‘yes.’ I left her office and got this scripture for her the following day. The next time I saw her, she was sitting as a Judge in the high court. <b>When you are favoured by God, you don’t need to curry human favour.</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The favour of God is a product of divine sovereignty. In Daniel 4:17 and 25, Nebuchadnezzar the king, having learnt his lesson, came to the realization that God had the prerogative of divine allocation of blessings and privileges. It is so good to remain rooted in Christ so we can enjoy the wonders of divine favour. It sets the poor among princes and puts the slave on the throne. The favour of God makes those who do not want you in the position which God has ordained for you to be helpless so they can do nothing about it. David’s testimony in Psalm 23:5 is a testimony of God’s favour. <b>When God shows your light, no person can put it out.</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Get ready to enjoy God’s favour by disconnecting from your manmade schemes of getting things done through manipulation and corruption. That is immoral and ungodly. Whatever God gives is what is guaranteed to last long. Surrender all to Jesus and He will cause you to shine and make the enemy helpless about it. Rejoice in the Lord.
