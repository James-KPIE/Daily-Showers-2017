            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Pro. 3:33</strong> <br>                         
The curse of the LORD is in 
the house of the wicked: but 
he blesseth the habitation 
of the just.</code></pre>

				People may suffer delay in their journeys through life due to partial or collective captivity. Partial captivity occurs when a single person, out of many people, suffers, because of a certain oppression. Collective captivity often occurs when everyone in a clan or family or a generation suffers under certain curses which place limitations on their
progress or advancement. Until such curses are broken, such families could experience stagnation, degradation or lack of progress.
<br /><br />
The family of Eli came under a serious curse from the mouth of the Lord as a result of the wickedness of the sons of Eli and Eli’s non–chalant attitude in bringing his children under control. It was so bad with Eli himself that when the warning of the Lord came through the young Samuel, Eli dared God to do whatever He deemed fit. Little wonder the curses of God became so heavy on the family of Eli and all their descendants. The terrible thing with such curses is that even the children who are born into such families, in their innocence would also partake of the curse. When anyone becomes aware of such curses he or she needs to organize deliverance prayer so as to break the curses and become free to enjoy the true liberty which salvation offers.

				<p>Many people are hardworking but they don’t have much to show for their efforts. It could be that a curse is hanging upon their heads. There are self–incurred curses and there are inherited curses. The Bible shows us an example of a self–imposed curse in Proverbs 17:13 which says: <blockquote>“whoever rewards evil for good, evil will not depart from his house.”</blockquote> Sin will also bring curses. That is why the Bible says in Isaiah 3:11 that it shall be ill with the sinner. A person who is cursed by God can hardly do well. Such a person will operate under serious limitations and delays in different areas may be his lot. Proverbs 13:15(b) says that the way of the transgressor is hard. Whoever is blessed by God will have all the powers and the things created by God working for him, but whoever is cursed by the Lord will have such powers and creatures of God work against him or her. May God bless you and never curse you. Amen.

The family of King Abimelech came under a curse in Genesis 20 because the King took Sarah the wife of Abraham, innocently. Nevertheless the curse from the Lord came upon the house of the king. Abraham had to pray off those curses from his family after he (king Abimelech) restored Sarah back to her husband. Curse can cause delays. Rejoice in the Lord.
