					There are three prayers I consider as the most powerful of all prayers. <b>The first is to ask God for His mercy.</b> When the mercy of the Lord answers for you, victory is easy and you will have testimonies. Indeed, your case will be like a person who is perfect in the things he does whereas it is the mercy of God that puts things in
place. <b>The second prayer is to ask God to remember you.</b> God never forgets anyone, in the real sense of the word, but when He remembers you, it is as if He opens the heaven over your life and success becomes easy and rapid for you. <b>The third prayer is to ask for help from God or ask Him to send helpers.</b> You and I need helpers. If you are a producer, you need the help of someone to sell your product in the ever competitive market. If you are an author you need someone to read your book and much more to recommend it to other people for their use.

					This manual has grown steadily in acceptance in the past eleven years. Every subsequent year has witnessed a greater demand around the globe. Thank God for all of you around the world who use the manual and introduce it to other brethren. My joy knew no bounds, for example, in the third week of January 2016 when a servant of our great God whose ministry is based in the Middle East called and offered to help circulate the manual in that region and even beyond. I told him he was an answer to my prayer. He is a helper the kingdom will reward forever.

David entered into a battle from the most unlikely of all persons. The king whose dynasty he had helped to preserve and whose kingdom he had prevented from becoming a slave-nation to the Philistines, declared war against him. Saul was helpless when Goliath harassed and humiliated Israel for forty days. No man could face him until David showed up from the backside of the desert. He won the battle for the nation and God even used him to bring healing to the same king Saul a few times. Yet, Saul wanted to kill him. Then, God raised a friend and a ‘saviour’ for David from an unusual source too: Jonathan, the prince of King Saul. God used him to thwart the plans of King Saul by leaking vital logistic secrets to David. May God send you helpers in your hour of need and distress. Rejoice in the Lord.				</p>
