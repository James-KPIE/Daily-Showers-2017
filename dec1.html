            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Matthew 6:25-33 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Matt. 6:33</strong> <br>                         
But seek ye first the
kingdom of God, and
his righteousness;
and all these things
shall be added unto
you.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>We shall close the year by reflecting further on the kingdom of God which Jesus Christ came to the earth to establish. Jesus Christ did not come to the earth to establish a religion. He came to establish the kingdom of heaven on earth. That is the task of the church – to bring
people into His kingdom. See Colossians 1:13. He shed His blood to
facilitate the cleansing of those who would constitute the church. (Hebrew 9:22 and 1 John 1:7-9). He did not give the key to any religion unto anyone but He gave the keys of the kingdom to those who are redeemed by His blood to allow or disallow the occurrence of certain things on the earth in their domain as they remain connected to heaven. Religion is simply an idea of the worship of any deity and that has existed since time immemorial. Those who are saved by the blood of Jesus become His kingdom citizens. They are kings and priests upon whom He reigns as King of kings and He is their High Priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The purpose of Jesus Christ’s earthly ministry (which ministry is continued by the Holy Spirit) is to cause the people who had been alienated from God through the sin of Adam to be reconciled back to God. And the way to that reconciliation is repentance and forgiveness that lead to sonship. Jesus Christ is the Prince of Peace and only Him has the power to establish peace between man and God. Therefore the Christian faith is primarily focused on relationship rather than the establishment of a religion. Jesus Christ the everlasting King of His kingdom (Isaiah 9:6) and He cannot be belittled with the title of a religious leader. He is God who came from heaven (John 3:13). He is the Creator of all the so-called founders of religions. He is the only One who came from heaven and He declared it as so. All the self-acclaimed religious leaders were born of men and women and grew up with the idea of religion which they sold to their followers in their own darkness and such followers remain in darkness ever since. Jesus Christ is the light of the world and only those who are redeemed by His blood are the children of light and citizens of His kingdom.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The first time Jesus Christ preached according to the gospel account was in Matthew 4:17 and all He did was to announce the kingdom over which He is the King. The gateway to entering the kingdom is repentance. There is nothing else that will qualify a sinful man or a woman for entering into that kingdom. No good work or family history will take anyone into the kingdom. Are you seeking the kingdom? Don’t delay, don’t just be religious. Begin to seek the kingdom. Rejoice in the Lord.
