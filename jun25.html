            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Job 29:4-17 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Pro. 21:13</strong> <br>                         
Whoso stoppeth his
ears at the cry of the
poor, he also shall
cry himself, but
shall not be heard.</code></pre>

				We shall consider some obstacles to securing supernatural intervention for some days from today. Indeed, the exhortation for the last two days should have opened our eyes to what might have hindered some of us from enjoying unceasing intervention in our
affairs. The trick of the devil is always to prevent us from seeing those seemingly little foxes that eat the vine. Many times we deal with symptoms rather than the root causes of our challenges. Not too long ago, a brother got a new job after he called his wife to ask her for forgiveness for his misdeed towards her. Obedience in little things can bring notable turnaround in many areas of our lives.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				One of the obstacles to supernatural intervention is the neglect of the poor. Indeed, the poor people around us are our covenant opportunity for securing supernatural intervention. Job’s increase and unending progress was due to his commitment to the pursuit of the interest of the down-trodden in the society. He fought for the oppressed and sought to defend the weak. In return, God spread his root by the waters (verse 19). Only a few people can rise up again from the colossal losses which Job suffered in his business and the loss of his children. However, Job rose again by the hand of the Lord and his latter end was better than his beginning. His children did not need to return because they had gone to a better home to be with God.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Our memory verse for today is a scripture that shook me when I read it for the first time many years ago. I meditated over it and I stood in awe of God. You may be living holy, serving God and carrying out other responsibilities in the church and everyone acclaims you a brother or sister in good standing but you have challenges that are almost disproving the efficacy of your faith. It is possible that the reason why divine intervention is far from you is that you have shut your ears to the cry of the poor. When was the last time that you did something to alleviate the suffering of a poor fellow around you, even in the church? Ministering to the poor is part of the much that needs to go out from your little so that your little can become much. Don’t neglect the poor, do the little you can to assist the poor from time to time and watch God bless you. Rejoice in the Lord.
