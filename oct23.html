And he removed from thence, and 
digged another well; and for 
that they strove not: and he 
called the name of it Rehoboth; 
and he said, For now the LORD 
hath made room for us, and we 
shall be fruitful in the land.</code></pre>

				Whenever you find out that some enemies are working against your progress, it is time to work harder. To slow down at such points is not only dangerous but it can make you lose enthusiasm and momentum. The breakthrough of Isaac as an agrarian entrepreneur was delayed because of the wicked resistance posed by inherited arresters. These were the same enemies who withstood his father Abraham when he was digging wells in the desert to ensure that his cattle business did not flop. You will recall that Abraham graciously conceded the
watered plain of Jordan to Lot in order to maintain peace with his cousin. That meant that Abraham was left to work harder in search of water for the grazing of the cattle. The strategy of the enemies of Abraham was to contest for the wells which his servants dug or to fill them with sand. Somehow, Abraham overcame and prospered because the Lord was with him (Genesis 21:22). When those enemies could not stop the father, they turned to the son.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Isaac had engaged his human logic to conclude that it was safe to move out of Gerar in the land of the Philistines, to Egypt where he could find greener pasture as there was famine in Gerar. But that was not God’s idea. The same factor which guaranteed the success of his father would also work for him and that was divine presence that translates into divine partnership. In Genesis 26:3, God told Isaac specifically that He would be with him. As soon as Isaac received that assurance he began to make moves. You see, every vision that is not supported with action stands the risks of frustration and abandonment. Isaac went to work and diligently pursued his business. But the enemies turned their attention to him and did to him just as they did to Abraham his father. But the God of Abraham rose up for him as the God of Isaac and his servants wearied the enemies by the force of diligence. They did not give up until they got their breakthrough. Through diligence and perseverance Isaac got to the place he called Rehoboth, where the Lord made room for him.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The prosperity of Isaac would have been delayed if he had followed his own instinct rather than the voice of the Lord. We must learn from Isaac that the fact that God is on our side does not mean that we shall not face opposition but we have the guarantee that ultimately we shall win and that is what counts. Do you have thick opposition against your progress? Stick to God and work harder. Like Isaac you will weary the opposition by the hand of God. Rejoice in the Lord.
