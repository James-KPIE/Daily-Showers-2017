            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: John 14:27</strong> <br>                         
Peace I leave with you, 
my peace I give unto you: 
not as the world giveth, 
give I unto you. Let not 
your heart be troubled, 
neither let it be afraid.</code></pre>

				<p>
				When Jesus Christ our Lord made an offering of Himself on the cross as an eternal offering for our sin, He reconciled us to the Father and restored our peace with God. That peace was lost in the Garden of Eden when Adam and Eve sinned against God. No sinner has peace with God, however much he may pretend. It is only those who have peace with God that can truly say ‘It is well with my soul’ according to Isaiah 3:10. The next verse
confirms the lot of the unsaved and who is therefore, cut off from God when it says that it is ill with the wicked. The righteous is the person who is saved by the precious blood of Jesus and the wicked is the sinner who is estranged from God. Isaiah 48:22 says there is no peace for the wicked. The way to peace with God, for the sinner, is to repent.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				How much do you treasure this great blessing of the believer in Christ? Are you careful daily, not to lose your peace with God? You must live daily with a conscience void of offence before man and God in order to maintain that precious peace. Peace is a state of mind of the believer whereby through the grace that flowed from Calvary we are spiritually united with the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. When the peace of the Lord floods your heart, you will be immovable by the challenges that make other people to panic. Peace is not the absence of troubles but the presence of God with you in all that you are going through. David enjoyed this peace with God. That is why he declared in Psalm 27:13 that he had almost fainted but for his faith which remained unshaken in the Almighty God. In his troubles, he had peace with God.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Are you facing daunting challenges today? Please don’t lose your peace and don’t lose your faith. You need to be at peace in your mind to be able to exercise your faith. Please breathe in the peace of God as you find scriptures to anchor your faith on, in a challenging time such as this. Don’t entertain any suggestion of suicide. Don’t externalize your aggression against any person. Don’t even suspect anybody as the cause of your woes. Turn your heart totally unto God and receive His peace afresh. Give Him praise and glory for the solution He will work out soon. Where you are today is not your last bus stop. Rejoice in the Lord.
