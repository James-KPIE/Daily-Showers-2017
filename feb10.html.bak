            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Gal. 6:7-9</h3>
            <pre><code> M.V: Eccl. 11:6<b style="color:red"></b> <br>                         
In the morning sow
thy seed, and in the
evening withhold
not thine hand: for
thou knowest
not whether shall
prosper, either this
or that, or whether
they both shall be
alike good.</code></pre>The kingdom covenant reward system which we have been considering for a few days now has some laws which are common to all our deeds for which God has promised a reward. One of such laws is the law of consistency. Indeed our Lord Jesus made this law a basic requirement for those who desire to make heaven at last. In Luke 9:62, He told us that a man who puts his hands to the plow and looks back is not fit for the kingdom of God. Indeed, in every aspect of our Christian<br><br>adventure, consistency is the rule. We cannot afford to be hot today and cold next day. We cannot be forgivers today and go into unforgiveness next time. We cannot be prayerful this year and become prayerless next year. God does not have interest in such Christianity.<br>With specific reference to the giving grace, once you have the revelation of God and the spirit of giving fastened to your heart, you cannot look back. It is just the same with paying our tithe. I believe that every serious child of God should be an addicted tither. We shall see this practice in Abraham’s life in these series when we consider the credential that qualified Abraham to ‘have’ God in His excellence, power and glory; because God literally ‘gave’ Himself to Abraham according to Genesis 15:1.<br><br>As givers, we need to be consistent in sowing our seed. We need to continue to give as long as it is in our power or ability to do so. I told brethren before that God never expects you to give what He has not given to you in the first place. No, the power of consistency is in the nature which we share with God after we have been converted and are saved. (2 Peter 1:3-4). You will not stop giving as long as you have the opportunity once you have experienced the breakthrough in giving. Each believer needs to grow to that level in the Christian journey. Then, consistency becomes easy. Rejoice in the Lord.<br><br><div
