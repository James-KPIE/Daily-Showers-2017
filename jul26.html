            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: 2 Kings 4:8-17 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Ps. 5:12</strong> <br>                         
For thou, LORD, wilt 
bless the righteous; 
with favour wilt thou 
compass him as with 
a shield.</code></pre>

				Favour is the product of grace and grace is the profit of the cross. It is grace that elects a person for favour and a favoured person can enjoy a benefit which he is not, otherwise, qualified for. Favour takes the spirit of strife out of the life of a child of God because whatever he is favoured for cannot be denied
him, the conspiracy and activities of the enemies notwithstanding. Favour can cause a person to be blessed out of order. Favour will make strangers to be willing to help you. When you are favoured by God, all things will work to your advantage.
				</p>

				The favour which the woman of Shunem enjoyed is our focus today. She was a great woman of substance but she had no child as her husband was old. She became highly favoured when grace pushed her to do the unusual. She began to entertain the man of God and did all she could to make the man of God comfortable including the provision of accommodation for the prophet of God. At that point, the man of God sent his servant to find out the need in the woman’s life. The servant found that she had no child and Elisha stepped in to address that need. The woman had written off the idea of having a child. However, the overriding anointing that was upon Elisha overrode the woman’s unbelief and by the following year, she gave birth to a boy. The boy grew sick for a short time and died but the anointing of God upon Elisha brought him back to life. When we step into God’s favour through the righteousness of Christ, we can enjoy favour all the way.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				In 2 Kings 8, the woman of Shunem enjoyed another level of favour. There was an imminent famine and information about it was ‘leaked’ by Elisha to this same woman. The prophet told her what to do and she did it. She left town for seven years during which time her land was used for farming by other people without her permission. After seven years she returned home and went to the king to ask that her land be restored to her. Through Elisha’s connection she got the proceeds from the usage of the land for those seven years by the order of the king as well. The favour of God makes struggles to cease and it can give us more than we bargain for. Rejoice in the Lord.
