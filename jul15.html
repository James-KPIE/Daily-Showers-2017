            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Proverbs 24:1-14 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Pro. 24:3</strong> <br>                         
Through wisdom is an house 
builded; and by understanding
 it is established:</code></pre>

				<p>
				Every Christian prospers according to the level of his understanding as far as the prosperity covenant is concerned. For example, we have been told that the only law of prosperity is giving and people cite Luke 6:38. While that scripture cannot
be broken, we need a platform of understanding by which it will deliver to us according to its content. If a Christian keeps giving just for the motive of getting blessed and there is no love in his heart, he is not better than a pagan. If a businessman is generous and gives to charity as a philanthropist but the wages of his workers are unpaid, what kind of liberality is that? I submit that the kind of giving that would provoke heaven for a release of blessings is the type that is motivated by love. That was the secret of the prosperity of Job (Job 29:1-20) and Solomon (1 Kings 3:3-13). Giving without the motivation of genuine agape love is nothing but economic trading.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We also need the understanding that there are fertile and unfertile grounds. When we study Matthew 13 on the parable of the sower, we will understand that even the seeds that were sown on the fertile soil did not produce alike. The thoughts of the sower, the confession of the sower after he had sown the seed, the expectations of the sower are all factors that bear spiritual effect on what he or she has sown. Each person has a connection with the seed which he or she sows. If a person is labouring under a curse which sentences that person to a closed heaven under Deuteronomy 28:15-24, how will his seed produce? We need deep understanding to profitably harness the blessings of the spoken word. There are people who steal money from their nations’ treasuries in Africa and go into churches to make fat donations for which they are applauded and prayed for by their pastors. What will God do with such corrupt seed? Your guess is as good as mine.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				When we give without such hindrances as we have just considered, faith must still be activated as we need to believe that God wants us to prosper. There are brethren who consider their status such as their educational attainment, their parental background and their immediate environment and come to the conclusion that may be God does not want them to prosper. That cannot be true in the light of the scripture. Psalm 35:27 concludes that God delights in the prosperity of His servants. 3 John 2 reinforces that position. Those are levels of understanding that will guarantee our prosperity. Rejoice in the Lord.
