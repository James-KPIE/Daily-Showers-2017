Then Peter arose and
went with them. When
he was come, they
brought him into the
upper chamber: and
all the widows stood by
him weeping, and
shewing the coats and
garments which Dorcas
made, while she was
with them.</code></pre>

					Every gesture of positive impact is like a deposit in our ‘savings account’ in heaven. There will be one day when we may need to draw from the credit in that account. If, for any, reason we miss opportunities to make such deposits, help may be far on the day of our desperate need. Read again Psalm 20:1-3 and you will see the need to continue to sow the seed of good deeds and thereby keep our heavenly account in credit.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The story of Dorcas shows us, once again that it is wise to live
beyond self and contribute in any way we can to the welfare of other people. And we will find that kind of opportunity in every place we find ourselves on the earth. Professionals in various fields can turn their fields of practice to a good place to sow the seed of goodness into other people’s lives. However, there are professionals who keep strictly to the practice of their profession, applying their professional skills without necessarily paying attention to people-skills. Those who thrive most in the things they do these-days are the people who build personal relationships through the discharge of their assignments. Without good relationship, trust cannot be developed, whether between the C.E.O and the employees or between the employees and the customers. People will always go back to the place where they can trust those who offer services to them and this is highly instructive for us all.
				</p>
				
				<p>
Sister Dorcas was not a very rich person but she was a carrier of value. She added value to the lives of different people whom she encountered in the course of her fashion designing business. In verse 36, we are told about her good works. As she prospered in her business, she engaged in giving gifts to people in cash and in kind. Those were the good works that people remembered when she became sick and died. With one voice, the people shouted and prayed that Dorcas should not die. At the funeral of an old woman a few days ago, I asked the people who were present during the interment whether anyone would miss them if they died. There are many people who cannot be remembered for any good, if they suddenly die. People helped to make withdrawals from Dorcas’ account and the withdrawals led to her being raised from premature death.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Whatsoever a man sows, he shall also reap. Don’t leave your account empty so you may make withdrawal on the day of need. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
