            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Matt. 4:9</strong> <br>                         

And saith unto him, 
All these things will 
I give thee, if thou 
wilt fall down and 
worship me.</code></pre>

				The end of worldliness is vainglory. Have you considered the lives of those who are worldly as they pursue those things which are of no eternal values and mortgage their souls in their curiosity to get ahead of other people? The Bible says vanity upon vanity, all is vanity. The idol called vainglory is the subject matter of our devotion today.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				One of the obvious features of worldliness is <b>the rat-race.</b> This is the illusionary pursuit of an agenda to outdo everyone and get ahead of other people whether by hook or crook. It is the obsession mentality of people like king Nebuchadnezzar who took a look at his sprawling palace and took the credit for building such a magnificent edifice. Of course, he paid dearly for such a foolish display of arrogance. Whatever pursuit you have with the sole aim of being acclaimed as being the best in order to claim self–glory, is a pursuit of vainglory. Thank God for David who was king over Israel when the nation gathered the resources for the building of the temple in 1 Chronicles 29. In his final submissions before the people of Israel, two things were prominent in his speech–God and His people. He also placed emphasis on the fact that what they gave towards the building was given unto them by God in the first place (read verse 10-20). David took no credit for everything and that is a lesson for all of us.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Vainglory is everywhere, even in the church. If I secretly desire to be the best pastor that ever pastored my parish that is vainglory. If I secretly nurse the ambition to be the superstar miracle–working pastor in the city, that is vainglory. If, as an elite lady in the church, your inner thoughts tend toward appearing as the most expensive lady in the church, that is vainglory. It is all about the state of your heart. On the contrary, you may be the richest person on earth and may ride the best car in town and live in the best architecturally designed house and yet, you do not lose your head or lord it over anyone. If your desire, like David is to glorify God in all things, then you are not after vain glory. We must run away from seeking vainglory for it will cause us to dissipate energy unnecessarily and ultimately lead to hell. Rejoice in the Lord.
