            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Psalm 50:5</strong> <br>                         
Gather my saints
together unto me;
those that have made
a covenant with
me by sacrifice</code></pre>

				<p>
				Many Christians have underestimated the power of engaging in covenant practices such as tithing, first-fruit and honouring of one’s parents or supporting higher vessels. Such practices can become a point of reference in the hour of difficulty as the records of such acts
are in heaven and God always remembers. The scripture is clear on what God has promised to do when we are faithful in bringing the tithe to His house. As we bring the tithe to living vessels of God, it is Jesus Christ, the High Priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek who receives it from us (Hebrews 7:8; Psalm 110:4). To keep the devourer away is God’s commitment to preserve our increase. That is what the tithes will cause God to do. To open the windows of heaven and pour on us a blessing refers to a supernatural impartation that qualifies us for new ideas and opportunities which can keep us perpetually in a drought-free season (See Malachi 3:10-12).
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Many years ago a corn farmer needed divine intervention when his maize did not bring out flower on time. Somehow he remembered his tithing and took his tithe card to the farm and went through the large farm waving the card. Within twenty four hours of doing so, the maize began to flower and his harvest was bountiful. You can show your tithe card to the pain which is ravaging a part of your body and insist that as a tither you have been rescued from the curse that brings sickness because sickness is a devourer. Tithe exempts us from curses because God says that he who refuses to pay tithe is cursed (Malachi 3:8-9).
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<b>You may not be able to pray off a divine agenda for a generation, but you can seek covenant exemption.</b> Hezekiah took the record of his service to God in the hour when death came to pick him and God kept him alive for another fifteen years. You will recall that Dorcas came alive from premature death through the gateway of service (Acts 9:36). Covenant practices can be your plea in the hour of difficulty because God never forgets. We shall consider this issue a little more tomorrow. The wisdom in covenant practices is that they create a credit line in heaven on your account and God may look at them and intervene in your affair. Rejoice in the Lord.
