            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Jn. 15:4</strong> <br>                         
Abide in me, and I in you. 
As the branch cannot bear 
fruit of itself, except it 
abide in the vine; no more 
can ye, except ye abide 
in me.</code></pre>

				A fruitful life is a life of impact. It is a life that shows that we are influenced by the Holy Spirit. Some of the details we shall see tomorrow. Our attention today will be focused on how much usefulness we have brought to our world as a result of being saved. For example, we can check the number of people with whom we have shared the gospel since we were saved and even the converts that we have through the working of the Holy
Spirit in us. Jesus Christ is the Saviour and the Holy Spirit does the work of conviction of the sinner. When we consciously initiate that process and a sinner surrenders his or her life to Christ and becomes saved, God takes the glory but we share in the joy. We are not fruitful if our lives do not impact sinners for Christ.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Secondly, we can gauge our fruitfulness by the impact of our character as born again children of God, especially among the people with whom we relate. We can create a difference in our work environment because we have become different. This is glaring in communities where people are corrupt and where people are morally bankrupt. Such are the places which the Bible refers to as being in darkness. As children of light, our response should be to transmit the light of the gospel into such areas. Therefore, our character must be above question and our integrity must be intact. Christlikeness is being fruitful in character by living according to God’s standard in the Bible. Each of us must be identified with Christ through our character and that is the best way to live for Christ.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The design of God, for us in Christ, is to grow up. We do not become mature believers from the day we are saved. Rather, we yield our hearts to God on that day and we begin to learn of Him. At the beginning, we may find issues like forgiveness, tithing, submission to one another and so on, difficult to grasp. Once the fruit of repentance begins to show in us as we do not continue in the sinful way of our pre–conversion life, that is a good way to start. As we become much more teachable through humility, those things that we found difficult to understand will become simple to grasp as we receive understanding. As we do them we shall become more fruitful. Rejoice in the Lord.
