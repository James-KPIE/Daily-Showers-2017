            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Psalm 16 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Ps. 16:11</strong> <br>                         
Thou wilt shew me the
path of life: in thy
presence is fullness of
joy; at thy right hand
there are pleasures for
evermore.</code></pre>

				We considered some of the benefits of authentic spiritual worship a few days ago but they were not exhaustive. We shall spend on or two more days to explore this great asset of every believer. David was one of the worship addicts (permit that expression) of God in the Bible. Little wonder his life was one of
victory from one battle to another. Those who ‘carry’ the presence of God wherever they go are unstoppable winners. Through worship, you can always enter into the presence of God as David did and enjoy divine partnership because when you are in His presence you are able to receive instructions that guarantee victory from your Commander-in-Chief, the Lord of hosts and the Man of war, who has never lost a war.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				It is certain to everyone that no man possesses the natural power to handle a lion. Yet, David fought and killed a lion just as he did a bear. It was the power of God’s presence that enabled David to do those exploits. You will also recall that when Samson was still connected to God, he was a nightmare to the Philistines. He killed one thousand Philistines with the jawbone of an ass (Judges 15:15). At one time, he uprooted the gate to a city and carried it on his shoulder. Such was the power of God’s presence upon the anointed instruments of God. When David faced Goliath, he was a no-match for the war veteran. How could a young lad who was keeping watch over his father’s few cattle at the backside of the desert square up with a man who carried with him sophisticated military weapons? Even the stature of Goliath alone made the hearts of the Israelites whom he had harassed for forty days and forty nights to melt. However, the presence of God makes you to see God magnified and the adversary ‘minimized.’ Those who cannot swim in the flood of God’s presence will always magnify their challenges and when you do so, you become impotent at handling such a challenge. David overcame Goliath by the power of God’s presence.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Worship is one of our gateways to the supernatural. God has never ‘denied’ Himself to man or a woman who seeks to worship Him in truth and in Spirit. And it is never too late to begin to explore this great spiritual asset. Won’t you? Rejoice in the Lord.
