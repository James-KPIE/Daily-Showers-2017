            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Isaiah 37:15-36 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Acts 12:11</strong> <br>                         
And when Peter was come 
to himself, he said, Now 
I know of a surety, that 
the Lord hath sent his 
angel, and hath delivered 
me out of the hand of Herod, 
and from all the expectation 
of the people of the Jews.</code></pre>

				<p>
				God used His angels to bring permanent solutions to the problems of men and He still does. In Judges 13, it was an angel who announced to Samson’s mother that her barrenness was over. Whenever God sends one of His ministering angels to make such announcement, that would be the end of the problem. In Psalm 34:7, the Bible says that the Lord surrounds us with His angels to continue to minister to the righteous. Angels are positioned around us to ward off evil forces that
may want to attack us or cause an evil occurrence. The harassment of Herod and his conspiracy to terminate the life of our Lord Jesus at infancy was checkmated by angelic intervention. The Lord sent His angel to give instructions to Joseph and Mary and, as they followed the instruction, the evil plot was aborted.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The story in our Bible passage for today tells of how strong and powerful a single angel can be. Angels are spirits and they operate with supernatural strength. Sennacherib had harassed and intimidated Hezekiah and the nation for many days and had threatened to attack Judah, boasting that no god could deliver anyone from his hand. He even narrated his exploits along that line and his posture was intimidating. So, Hezekiah cried to the Lord. A word of prophecy came from Prophet Isaiah which said that the army of Sennacherib would not overrun Judah. The army came in their hundreds of thousands against a tiny country of Judah but God demonstrated His awesome power by striking all the 185,000 Assyrian soldiers dead by the hand of a single angel. In Acts 12:1-11, God sent an angel who delivered Peter from prison. Herod had kept Peter in the prison with the intention to kill him after he had killed James the brother of John but the church prayed and God sent an angel to rescue Peter.
				</p>
				
				<p>	
The ministry of angels has not been terminated by God. Angels are sent to minister to us. We don’t worship them. One of the angels refused the worship of John the beloved when he was receiving the revelation from our Lord Jesus Christ. All we need do is to position ourselves in holiness and in faith so that God can send solutions to us through His angels. It is our privilege in redemption and we should expect this to happen according to the will of God. Rejoice in the Lord.
