            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: John 8:36</strong> <br>                         
If the Son therefore
shall make you free,
ye shall be free
indeed.</code></pre>

				<p>Jesus Christ hates all kinds of oppression. His mind could not accommodate human suffering. That is why He did some healings on the Sabbath. He could not bear to see a blind man wait till the following day before the man would be healed. Therefore He healed the
man who had an infirmity for thirty eight years on the Sabbath, in John chapter 5. In Luke 13:11-16, Jesus Christ healed another woman who had infirmity for eighteen years also on the Sabbath day. The Pharisees who criticized Him for healing on the Sabbath day were rebuked by Jesus Christ in verse 15. Jesus came to set the captive free (Luke 4:18). This was a cardinal purpose for which Jesus Christ came to the earth.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<b>Every believer is on an enforcement mission on the earth. We are here to engage in the spiritual battle for the actualization of our redemptive status.</b> This is not a physical battle neither is it a fight against physical persons. It is a battle that is inspired by spiritual understanding and for which we are equipped with spiritual weapons. Such weapons include faith. We do not just believe through faith but we fight spiritual battles through faith. Every other weapon of our warfare such as the word of God is ignited and activated by faith. According to Ephesians 6:16, faith is the ‘above all’ weapon. It is our weapon of triumph. 1John 5:4 says <blockquote>“For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.”</blockquote> Without faith in Jesus Christ we cannot overcome but with faith in Jesus Christ as the Son of God our triumph is guaranteed.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Every believer who desires to be free from all oppression whether it is the oppression of the mind or the body must appropriate the work which Jesus Christ had done on the Calvary, personally. He must meditate on the word of the victory until it becomes a reality in his spirit. When the word grows mightily in that area it will prevail. Are you oppressed in any area of your life? Is Satan resisting you from advancing in any particular pursuit or are you finding it difficult to become who Christ says you are according to the scriptures? If so, it is time to arise in the order of Deuteronomy 2:24 and contend with every enemy who is sitting upon your inheritance. Don’t give up and don’t give in until your victory becomes certain. He that Jesus had set free must be free indeed. Step in to enforce the victory which Jesus won for you at Calvary. Rejoice in the Lord.
