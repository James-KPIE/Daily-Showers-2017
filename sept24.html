            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Genesis 11:27-32 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Gen. 11:31</strong> <br>                         
And Terah took Abram his son, 
and Lot the son of Haran his 
son's son, and Sarai his 
daughter in law, his son 
Abram's wife; and they went 
forth with them from Ur of 
the Chaldees, to go into the 
land of Canaan; and they 
came unto Haran, and 
dwelt there.</code></pre>

				Many people suffer delay in the journey to their destination in life because of the kind of people in their company. Many people started off in an unfortunate manner early in life because when they were young they were not wise enough to choose friends who would have positive influence on them. On the contrary, they fell for friends who had evil inclinations. Such people became corrupt and went deeper and deeper into sin until their early life journeys were cut short or slowed down. It is true, according to the Bible, that bad company corrupts good character. Some of us were very fortunate not to go that
way early in life and indeed, we thank God for taking us through that stage safely. Thank God!
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Abraham’s experience shows us the effect of negative influence on the journey of life. The Bible says in Genesis 12:1 that God had called Abraham while he was still with his parents. The King James Version puts it in a very clear picture it says “And God had said to Abraham…” This means the call was made to Abraham earlier than Genesis 12:1. The father of faith must have stayed with his father Terah for longer than was necessary, just as some of us delayed our response to God’s call for our salvation or as some delayed coming in to serve in the kingdom of God. Probably Abraham should not have embarked on the journey to Canaan with his father according to the passage we read today. It was a journey in which the captain of the team was Mr. Delay because that was the meaning of Terah’s name. The company which embarked on that journey never got to Canaan because their leader stopped at Haran. Haran settled in the land and prospered there but Abraham got nothing from that journey because he ought not to have been there, according to God’s plan. Abraham must have returned to God when that journey ended in futility for him.
				</p>
				
				<p>	
Our reasoning in this last paragraph is given veracity because in Genesis 11:31, the Word says: “and they went out with them” which means some people were not supposed to be in that company and Abraham and his wife must be the they. The delay in Abraham’s journey of life must have been due to that wrong company. Do you have a Terah travelling with you as your captain? Watch it. Rejoice in the Lord.
