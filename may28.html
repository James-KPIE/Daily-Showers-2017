            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Eph. 4:14</strong> <br>                         

That we henceforth be 
no more children, tossed 
to and fro, and carried 
about with every wind of 
doctrine, by the sleight 
of men, and cunning 
craftiness, whereby they 
lie in wait to deceive;</code></pre>

				<p>
				There are spiritual babes who can be regarded as crawlers. Every crawling child needs help and the direction of his movement is not entirely at his discretion. Those who are crawling spiritually are church–goers who do not have the conviction that will form the bedrock of their stand in the Lord. Such Christians may still have doubts as to whether they can totally trust their lives unto Jesus Christ. The people in this
category are yet to fully understand the doctrines or principles for Christian living as stated in the Bible. They can still be confused by false prophets who have persuasive ability in propagating their own doctrines which are not Biblical. Such crawling Christians need the support and mentoring of more mature Christians in order to get them established in Christ.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				One of the reasons why we have many people in this category today is the plague of casual Christianity. Many people are casual about their faith. Without becoming violent or becoming religious terrorists, we need to be more radical about our faith in Christ. We need to be more hungry for God and give the pursuit of the salvation of our souls all it may take, without looking back. That is the counsel of our Lord Jesus Christ in Luke 9:62. As a pastor, I have seen a sharp decline in the commitment of Christians to the faith we profess in the last twenty years. There seems to be a terrible spirit out there which makes many Christians so self–willed that they choose which spiritual instructions to obey and the ones to ignore. The most deadly of the plagues ravaging us this hour is lack of the fear of God. It appears that the devil has successfully replayed the encounter he had with Eve in the garden in the heart of many Christians. We seem to be wiser than the word which God has written for our salvation. We are doomed when the word of God no longer guide our actions because the fear of God is not in us.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Many people are in the church today who do not have Christ inside of them. They are crawlers. They are spiritually immature and weak. They have little or no time to hear God directly through His word. All they can boast of knowing is what they hear the preachers preach. They do not make any attempt to discover God personally. Are you a crawler? Accept the challenge to outgrow that stage. Rejoice in the Lord.
