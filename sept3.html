            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Jh. 1:45</strong> <br>                         
Philip findeth Nathanael, 
and saith unto him, We have 
found him, of whom Moses 
in the law, and the prophets, 
did write, Jesus of Nazareth, 
the son of Joseph.</code></pre>

				<p>
				We shall consider the subject of kingdom expansion today. Who should be your target for evangelism and soul–winning? At least four groups of people have been identified as the people with whom you can share Christ with little or no fear of danger because of familiarity. It must be admitted that there are communities where Christian evangelism is outlawed but the Holy Spirit can help us to penetrate those satanic barricades and even convict the heart of the hardest
opponents of the gospel. We must never rule out what the Holy Spirit can do in saving the souls of those who oppose the way like Saul of Tarsus.
<br /><br />
Your first target should be your family members. Over the centuries, many souls have been drawn into the kingdom when saved members of families took the responsibility to reach out to other members such as their fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters and even to the extended family members. You can share Christ with your family members without fear of attack. The multiplier effect of such efforts has been tremendous. Chances are that every new family member who comes into the light of the gospel and embraces Christ will invariably spread the good news to some other members of the family.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Your second target are your neighbours. I know of communities where neighbours don’t get to see one another for days and even weeks. Yet, we must not close our minds to any opportunity that may present itself in the neighbourhood. It may be during some national holiday or when you have events such as auto shows or agric shows. Some neighbourhoods have community days when dwellers in the community meet at socials. That is an opportunity to share the gospel with someone and give an invitation to church.
				</p>
				
				<p>
Your third target are your co–workers, if you work in a company or an establishment where many people are employed. For professionals who render services to clients, the same pattern can be followed–create some familiarity for the purpose of sharing the good news. Indeed wherever we work is a place to seek to save the lost. The people we make contact with everyday should be our target.
<br /><br />
Finally, we all have friends. They must not be neglected in our pursuit of soul –winning. Many souls are empty and they need Jesus. We can only know them if we engage them in the salvation conversation. Rejoice in the Lord.
