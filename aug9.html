            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Matt. 6:10</strong> <br>                         
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done in
earth, as it is in
heaven.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				The pursuit of kingdom expansion is a proof of Christian maturity. The nature of the newly born again child of God is to concentrate on the mundane and ephemeral things of this world. As we mature in Christ and
grow to love God and people more and more, if we stay with the word of God, we will find out what we call the heartbeat of God and we will begin to move in the direction of same. The heartbeat of God is the salvation of all men. God desires that all men be saved. The expression ‘men’ here includes every human being that God has created. The plan of God is to save all and that is why He sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to die for the sin of the world.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The content of our thoughts always shows our priorities and the direction of our lives. If our thoughts are centred on what we eat or drink only, then we need to grow. Jesus Christ our Lord said that is not the focus of the kingdom. Our priorities are outlined in the prayer which our Lord Jesus Himself taught us to pray. That prayer has several segments-from the acknowledgement of God as we reverence Him, to accepting personal responsibility for our actions, to expressing our reliance on Him as our Sustainer and putting our trust in Him as our Refuge and reverting all glory to Him for answered prayers (see my book titled The Altar of Fire). However, our point of emphasis in this prayer is the priority of the kingdom. The first request in the multi-legged prayer is that the kingdom of God be established here on earth. That is talking about the salvation of souls-the very reason why Jesus Christ left His throne and came to the earth.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Jesus Christ taught us the prayer to help us mature at the altar of prayer. When the kingdom is established in our heart, we will surely do the will of God. That life of prayer also looks beyond us as it is also an intercession for all the unsaved people in the world. God’s priority is that the knowledge of God will cover the earth through salvation as water covers the sea. The church of Jesus Christ must always make the intercession for the unsaved our priority when we pray. That will demonstrate maturity. That commitment will also endear us to God for His blessing because we share His heartbeat concerning the souls that are perishing. Rejoice in the Lord.
