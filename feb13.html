            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Eccl. 11:1-6 </h3>
            <pre><code>M.V: Eccl. 11:4<b style="color:red"></b> <br>                         
He that observeth the
wind shall not sow;
and he that regardeth
the clouds shall not
reap.</code></pre>We have considered several factors that could negatively affect the promised reward to our giving. Harvest is the heritage of sowers no doubt, but the sower must follow scriptural guidelines. In the first place having to consider economic conditions or to look at our<br>environment before we can sow our seed may cause us to doubt the efficacy of the word of God. The conditions may not look favourable but to sow our seed is an act of faith and faith is spiritual, not mental. The exercise of our faith cannot be based on the peculiar conditions or the unfavourable circumstances all around us. That is why our memory verse for today says that he who observes the wind shall not sow.<br><br>It is counter-productive to doubt what God can do as a result of earthly conditions. Every act of unbelief makes the doubter a loser. You will recall in 2 Kings 7:1-2 that when the man of God prophesied that two measures of barely shall be sold for one shekel the following morning, an officer of the king expressed some doubt that was even an insult to the omnipotence of God. The prophet promptly told him, by the overruling anointing, that he shall see it but shall not eat of it. And it was so. There are brethren who reason like that officer of the king in the hour when they should sow their seed. They consider the economy of their nation and write themselves off, financially. They consider the prices of shares in the stock market and decide to eat their seed. They forget that no season lasts forever. The Bible says God changes times and seasons. I reminded the congregation of God’s people recently that in 2001 at the advent of Global System for Mobile Communication (G.S.M) in Nigeria we bought a telephone sim card for N35,000.00 (Thirty Five Thousand Naira). At the time of writing this devotional (January 7, 2016) it can be bought for N200.00, (Two Hundred Naira). Sowers must see with the eyes of faith. Everyone would doubt that possibility fifteen years earlier. The living faith believes that things can get better.<br><br>Things are not going to remain as bad as they have been because we have the promise of God for the nations in 2 Chronicles 7:14 that life can get better if the saints cry unto their God. Let us do just that and watch God move. Rejoice in the Lord.<br><br><br><div
