            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Rom. 8:11</strong> <br>                         
But if the Spirit of him
that raised up Jesus
from the dead dwell in
you, he that raised up
Christ from the dead
shall also quicken your
mortal bodies by his
Spirit that dwelleth in
you.</code></pre>

				<p>
				The Holy Spirit is the power of resurrection. As we read a few days ago. He is co-existent and co-powerful with both God the Father and God the Son. The mystery of divinity is that God can manifest as God the Father or as God the Son or as God the Holy Spirit. Our Lord Jesus took the centre stage but was working with the Father (John 8:29, 10:30) and with the Holy Spirit (Luke 4:14; Acts 10:38) while He was physically present on the earth. At the end of His physical earthly
ministry, He committed us to the Holy Spirit as our Counsellor,
Comforter, Guide and Teacher. He directed us to receive divine power through Him (Acts 1:8). Whatever we receive from the Holy Spirit is given to us both by God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Healing through the Holy Spirit is therefore the continuity of the agenda of the Godhead for the victory of the redeemed over Satanic forces of oppression. Sickness is an oppression on the body and at times on the mind of man. Just as the blood of Jesus heals us through the atonement it provides (we saw that yesterday), the power of the Holy Spirit heals us too. It was the Holy Spirit that raised Jesus Christ from death. I believe that raising the dead is a greater task than healing the sick. In the body of a sick person there is still life. Only a part or some parts of the body which ails need divine touch. However, in the case of a dead person life is completely gone. So to bring the dead back to life requires total re-creativity. The dead person comes back through the creative power of God whereas the ill person becomes healthy through the curative miracle of God. Creative power seems superior to curative power. Both are in God and God administers each one as He pleases.
				<br /><br />
				The point in all these is that if the Holy Spirit raises the dead, He can heal us. Our memory verse therefore validates this thought that we can be healed when the Holy Spirit fills us and He quickens our mortal bodies. The word quicken means to give life to something. The Holy Spirit is the living spirit so He gives life to any part of our body which has suffered damage or is dead or needs repair.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				For all cases of healing that we may desire, faith is what we require to put in action. Of course being born again puts us at an advantage because your prayer for healing as a born again child of God is a demand and not a begging. Your prayer is to defend your healing status which Jesus perfected on the cross. Press on by faith and receive your healing today in the power of the Holy Spirit. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
