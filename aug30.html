            <h4 align="right">Tue. Aug. 30, 2017</h4>
            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Matt. 13:44-52 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Matt. 6:21</strong> <br>                         
For where your
treasure is, there will
your heart be also.</code></pre>

				Evangelism is a guarantee that we are building up our treasures in heaven. Christianity that encourages us to enjoy the blessings of victory, success, good health, protection, prosperity and promotion on earth without
turning our attention to how to gain heaven is not total Christianity. Have you ever asked yourself, as a Christian, whether you have any stored up treasure in heaven? It is while we are here on earth that we store up treasures in heaven. In fact, it will be late after death to talk of treasures in heaven. Most times, the value of the kingdom service which we render as well as the number of souls we have won all add up in our account so we can be credited per time. It may happen that we need to draw from such an account even while we are still here.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				In Daniel 3:17, while the three Hebrew boys were about to be thrown into the fiery furnace, they drew on their account in heaven which was already in credit. They spoke of <blockquote>“our God whom we serve”</blockquote> and there was response from heaven and God went ahead of them into the fiery furnace and turned the heat to cold so that fire did not have power over them. Daniel also drew on his heavenly account in Daniel 6:20-22. The king had touched on the issue first because he was aware that Daniel was a kingdom addict. The Lord came and shut the mouth of the lions. All these people had treasures in heaven for the mean time and for eternity. You will also recall the story of Dorcas in Acts 9:36. She was full of good works so her account in heaven was in credit. It was people who petitioned heaven when she died and placed a demand on her account to press for divine intervention and heaven responded. If you die prematurely today, can anyone petition heaven on your behalf pleading your good works? Many Christians are only useful to themselves and not to God or other people. That is unprofitable Christianity.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The issue of laying treasures in heaven begins with possessing the kingdom mentality. Until your thoughts are filled with heavenly thoughts your life may not count for the kingdom. Begin to think about how you can be of kingdom use. Create a budget for your time and choose which time to daily invest in the kingdom. Do so with your finances also. Become a soul-winning addict and very soon your treasures in heaven will build up. Rejoice in the Lord.
