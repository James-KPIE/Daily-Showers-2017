Then Jacob gave
Esau bread and
pottage of lentiles;
and he did eat and
drink, and rose up,
and went his way:
thus Esau despised
his birthright.</code></pre>

				In the present series on the ‘power of one,’ we shall consider the power of one meal today. As much as food is very important to the body, food is also very important to an entire destiny. Many people have lost their lives by eating just one meal that was poisoned.
Others have signed off their destiny by eating one meal by which they were initiated into cults. Some people have entered into real
trouble especially with their health when they ate the food from the hands of the wicked in their sleep. Spiritual caterers are wicked and the food they serve can trigger a life-time sickness or oppression when they succeed in afflicting a person who eats their food. One meal can also cause some great good to happen but we shall leave that for our consideration after Easter.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					When Esau asked Jacob for food when he was hungry and tired on that fateful afternoon, little did he know that the food would cost him his destiny. After eating the food, he swore to his younger brother and sold his birthright to Jacob. Esau failed to consider the future as his focus was for here and now. He was shortsighted as he gave up the ultimate to get the immediate and that was foolishness. May be Esau had thought that his father’s love would bail him out of the consequences of his poor decision but the issue of birthright has to do more with God than man. Esau’s foolish and careless decision brought very sad consequences especially when the ultimate blessing from their father was to be pronounced, based on their birthright, in Genesis 27:30-40. On that day, Esau realized that he should not have been casual with the issue of birthright. If the blessing of the first born was tied to his birthright which Esau had sold for a plate of food, circumstances must play out his exclusion from the blessing which their father was to pronounce on the firstborn. Esau lost the blessing when he gave his birthright away (Hebrews 12:16-17).
				</p>
				
				<p>
Casual Christianity can be very costly. Esau gave away his status of the firstborn and he wept bitterly for doing so. We have seen in the consideration of the power of one blessing that Isaac’s pronouncement was not for physical tangible blessings. Even when Esau asked his father if he had only one blessing and the father sought to make fresh pronouncement, Isaac reiterated that Esau would serve his brother. That is how powerful one meal can be. Rejoice in the Lord.
