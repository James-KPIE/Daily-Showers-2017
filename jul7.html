            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Romans 5:1-11 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Ps. 16:6</strong> <br>                         
The lines are fallen unto 
me in pleasant places; 
yea, I have a goodly 
heritage.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				Redemption has qualified us for a great heritage in Christ. The greatest and our most treasured portion of this heritage is eternal life. Irrespective of whatever may be our experience on this earth, whether we are rich or poor, whether we are popular
or unknown, whether the world judges us as successful or unsuccessful, eternity with the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit is at the peak of the joy of our salvation and we must stretch to hold unto this invaluable heritage.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The prospect of spending eternity in heaven is a strong motivation for living a holy, sanctified life here on earth. Therefore, we must get excited about that glorious future and let it be the driving force for our life here on earth. It follows, therefore, that our actions and reactions, our interactions and engagements, the practice of our vocations and the conduct of our businesses must be done with the consciousness of that precious heritage that we cannot lose. We must be ready to lose any other thing for the purpose of keeping our soul preserved for eternity.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The price we are willing to pay is the chief determinant of how valuable this heritage of eternal life is to us. As we shall consider from tomorrow, the pilgrims that went before us had a glimpse of the home country to which we all aspire to return and they let go the ephemeral things of this wretched world with all its vanities. We must remember those words of our Lord Jesus Christ in Mark 8:36 and take heed every day. He said: <blockquote>“For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? “</blockquote>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				What are you ready to give up to keep your soul? Many times, Christians forget this vital issue in the way they conduct their businesses and even the way they carry on the work of the kingdom. Imagine two living churches contending for the same property for this same gospel business and trying to outdo each other, especially when the property owner is an unbeliever! Is it not wise that as soon as we are aware that another church has shown interest in acquiring the property that should end the enquiry by the second church? May we not miss heaven even in the process of doing the kingdom work. Let us take heed. Rejoice in the Lord.
