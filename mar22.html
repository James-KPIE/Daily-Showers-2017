				Our memory verse of yesterday shows us that God will release a blessing (one blessing) upon the righteous who pays his or her tithe–just one blessing. It is called a token of spiritual blessing that produces other blessings. For good measure, the blessing is the intangible spiritual thing that produces the tangible. The blessing is an anointing–it is the deposit of the Holy Spirit in the believer’s victorious life.<br /><br />
The story of Jacob and how he got the blessing which Isaac intended for Esau is the subject for our consideration today. There is no better story in the Bible that underscores the implications of the supernatural impartation which we call the blessing in a man’s life. In verses 28 and 29 Isaac pronounced blessing upon Jacob–a single compound blessing that would facilitate favour for Jacob from heaven and flourishing from the earth. His father asked God to give him the dew of heaven and the fatness of the earth. He also spoke dominion into Jacob’s life. Shortly thereafter, Esau came in and the father told him in verse 33 that he had blessed Jacob irreversibly. It would appear that that blessing (meant for the first son) could not be duplicated–only one person can be the head amongst two people. When Isaac told Esau that he had released the blessing on Jacob, Esau cried bitterly and asked the father in verse 38: “Hast thou but one blessing, my father? “If it was a physical or material blessing, Isaac could look into his storehouse or check his bank account to give something else to Esau but in this case, it was a spiritual blessing which could not be duplicated. His father told him it was gone.<br /><br />
The lesson we can learn from Esau’s case is that we should not be careless about spiritual things. I believe he missed the blessing right from Genesis 25 where he surrendered his birthright to Jacob, foolishly. The blessing of the first born rests squarely on his birthright and he had thrown it away. We must learn from Esau. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
