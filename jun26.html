            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: James 5:1-6 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Pro. 17:13</strong> <br>                         
Whoso rewardeth
evil for good, evil
shall not depart from
his house.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				Cheaters will always rob themselves of divine intervention. God hates cheaters. He does not stay on their side. He is a just and righteous God and He frowns at cheating. There are rich people
who withhold the wages of poor people who work for them,
not because they (the rich) cannot pay but just to flex their muscles or make the labourer to keep knocking on their door so as to appreciate how powerful the rich man is. However, that attitude is unwarranted and immoral. God says the wages of such people cry to Him in heaven. An act of unjust treatment of only one person may lead to the closure of a big business, if we understand who God is. Many businesses have nose-dived because of such patterns of iniquity. As it has been said, ‘a poor man who does not have power has prayers.’ The poor man who is unjustly treated can report the rich man to God and you don’t want to find yourself in such a situation.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The prayer of a cheater who desires divine intervention may hit a brick wall unless he goes through the path of repentance. Fasting will not even help a man whose prayers constitute an abomination unto God (Proverbs 15:8). Let us remind ourselves once again that <b>divine instruction is superior to divine intervention.</b> If you have been seeking supernatural intervention from God and nothing seems to happen, please check your life and the circumstances in which you relate with people. Have you cheated on your partner in marriage? Have you cheated on your business partner? You may need to humble yourself and ask for forgiveness or do restitution where it is practicable. This is not conservative religion but the raw word of God, undiluted. The Bible says if you refuse to abide by the truth, you will bear the consequences alone. If you do not deal with the problem at the root of a tree, it will continue to produce bad fruits traceable to unhealthy roots.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Whoever is too big to repent is too big to be saved or to be delivered. When we repent and forsake the cheating nature, relief will come and God will intervene just as He did to Jacob at Bethel and when he worked as a labourer under Laban. Be wise and cheat no more. Turn again to the Lord and enjoy divine intervention. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
