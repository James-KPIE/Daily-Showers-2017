            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Luke 18:1-8 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Luke 18:1</strong> <br>                         
And he spake a
parable unto them to
this end, that men
ought always to pray,
and not to faint;</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				A man who is tired of praying is tired of seeing God intervene in his affairs. Many people stop praying short of the time for their visitation by God. We have seen such situations. In some cases people took other steps which God did not approve, shortly before
God’s answer came to them. For example, Sarah’s counsel that Abraham should raise an offspring through her maid was not an instruction from God. The conflict that arose from that choice has remained with the Israelites and the Palestinians till today. Bless God He kept His promise to do what He had promised. Isaac was born at God’s own due season.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				For our prayer for divine intervention to be answered, we must set aside every alternative to the divine solution we are seeking from Christ. About two decades ago, a lady who was waiting for the fruit of the womb was introduced to someone who had other powers, to give children. She was given certain things to eat and she became pregnant. Her belly protruded for months and then years passed and she still did not deliver any baby. The powers that gave her the pregnancy must have caused it to vanish. To wait on God is to put your absolute trust in Jesus with a non-negotiable dependability that says ‘If God will not do it, let no other person try.’ Job said in Job 14:14 that he would endure throughout his season of waiting until his change would come. He declared his unshaken trust in God even during the trials. He said he would trust God even though he was slain by Him.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Divine intervention may be delayed where God is waiting to be ascribed the glory, for what we desire. He does not want to share the glory with another god or man. We must be careful not to attempt to help Him. When we go about striving to do in our strength what God should do, He will wait quietly because His Spirit will not strive with us (Genesis 6:3). Indeed, the Bible says it is a curse to strive with our Maker.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We must also avoid grumbling as we wait on God in prayers. Rather than worry, grumble or complain, it is better to take the posture of patience, praising God and giving glory to Him as we wait on Him. The pastor who preached on the day I gave my life to Christ said: “If you can pray, why worry and if you can worry, why pray?” Rejoice in the Lord.
