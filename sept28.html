            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: 1 Samuel 18:1-4</h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: 1 Sam. 18:3</strong> <br>                         
Then Jonathan and David made 
a covenant, because he 
loved him as his own soul.</code></pre>

				Helpers of destiny are people who are brought our way at critical times in our life’s journey and their intervention in helping us leaves a permanent and unforgettable story of change or positive transformation in our lives. Our chief helper of destiny is our Lord
Jesus Christ who left His throne in heaven and came to the earth to suffer and to die for our sins, so that through His death we may have life eternal. We are cleansed from our sin by His blood. Our encounter with Christ has effectively altered the course of our destiny which was supposed to end in hell. By His resurrection we are justified and by our faith in the works He accomplished on the cross, we have eternal life right from here. Glory be to God.
<br /><br />
Jonathan was not only a friend to David but he was a helper of his destiny. If it had not been for Jonathan, David’s life would have been cut short by Saul the king. The strange thing about their relationship was that Jonathan was king Saul’s son. If he had towed his father’s line of thought and aligned with the wicked plans of king Saul, Jonathan would have teamed up with his father to get rid of David. However, through divine arrangement, Jonathan became a strong defender of David. He defended David before his father but he could not persuade him to drop his wicked plans to kill David. So, Jonathan continued to disclose vital information to David and David was well guided through such information in avoiding all the plans of king Saul to kill him.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Jonathan was a most unlikely helper for David. When we trust in God absolutely in our hours of difficulty, God would use anyone to help us. A few days ago we saw how a young captive maid from Israel helped General Naaman to receive healing for his leprosy from Samaria under the ministry of Elisha. The woman of Shunem, who also became connected to Prophet Elisha, would also thank God for the impact the ministry of the man of God had in her life and in her family. God sent Elisha to the widow of Zarephat at a most crucial time and God used His servant to turn the situation for the widow and her son. In Romans 16, Paul acknowledged several families and brethren who were very helpful in the course of his ministry. They were sent as helpers.
				</p>
				
				<p>
One way to show gratitude to God for sending helpers our way is to also seek the people we can help. May God make you a helper of destiny to someone just as He has sent helpers to you. Amen. Rejoice in the Lord.				
				</p>
