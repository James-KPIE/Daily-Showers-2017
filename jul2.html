            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Matthew 27:45-54 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Rom. 8:28</strong> <br>                         
And we know that all 
things work together for 
good to them that love 
God, to them who are the 
called according to 
his purpose.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>God may also remain silent when what we are experiencing will work out His purpose. That is why He kept quiet and turned His face away from Jesus Christ when He bore our sins on the cross at Calvary and the Father exhausted His wrath for sin on His holy Son. It was the only time that the Father turned away from His Son as they were always together
as one (John 8:29, 10:30 and Acts 10:38). God never responded when Jesus cried to Him saying: “May Father, my Father, why have You forsaken me?” It was the peak of the actualization of God’s redemptive plan for mankind and to do anything out of emotional sympathy at that hour would scuttle the divine agenda. So, God kept quiet. And thank God that He kept quiet otherwise we would have all been doomed to spend eternity in hell.
				</p>
				
				<p>When Joseph went through all his ordeal in the hands of his brothers, it appeared that God was not mindful of him. God kept quiet because their cruelty was going to work out His purpose for the enthronement of Joseph so that he would occupy his seat of glory. Joseph told his brothers that there was a purpose which God set out to fulfill through his experience (Genesis 45:5-7 and Genesis 50:19-20). The very dream his brothers did everything to abort also came to pass. In Genesis 50:18, for the second time, they bowed down before Joseph to acknowledge his rulership over them and they said <blockquote>“Behold, we are your servants.”</blockquote> That was the purpose which God was working out to achieve when He kept quiet during the ordeals of Joseph in Potiphar’s house as a slave and even in prison as a prisoner.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				I don’t know if you can accept this–that God’s silence may actually be the expression of His love for us many times. Imagine that God allowed Haman to perfect his strategies to terminate Mordecai’s life and exterminate all the Jews in Shushan. He bribed the legislature to get a law to back his evil plans. Yet, God did not say a word until the time was very ripe for all the wicked plans of Haman to recoil upon his own head. Don’t be quick to complain as God may be working out His purpose by His silence. Rejoice in the Lord.
