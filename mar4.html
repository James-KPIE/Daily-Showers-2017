And Abraham stretched forth his 
hand, and took the knife to slay his son.</code></pre>


			<div>
				Love is a giver. No one loves who does not give. Abraham gave to men and in the process of showing liberality to men He “fed” God. Liberality is Abraham’s eleventh covenant credential. Abraham was used by God to present the world with
the rehearsal of the sacrifice of His only Son, Jesus Christ, which would be done for the remission of our sin. God told Abraham to sacrifice his only son. In the covenant reckoning, Isaac was the only son. God even went ahead to emphasize that Isaac was the son whom Abraham loved. God played out John 3:16 right in the scene of Genesis 22:2.<br /><br />
Abraham responded to God without any hesitation. The only explanation we have for his willingness to give up Isaac is in Hebrews 11. He had the insight that God brought Isaac out from the ‘dead body’ of a woman who had apparently passed the age of child–bearing, Abraham responded that through the omnipotence of God, He could raise the boy up from the dead in order to fulfill the promise which He made to him and his seed. Now, Isaac was the natural seed but spiritually Jesus Christ became that seed (Galatians 3:16 and Acts 3:25). Anyway, Abraham surrendered what was most precious to him–Isaac, to be offered as a burnt offering to the Lord.<br /><br />
I have heard some emphasis being placed on the fact that God merely tested Abraham. If you permit me, this was more than a mere test. If it was just a test, God should have turned Abraham back home before they climbed unto mountain Moriah. He bound the poor boy who was also gentle enough to surrender himself. Little wonder God blessed Abraham in that encounter but spoke multiplication into the destiny of Isaac (Genesis 22:17). The fulfillment came in Genesis 26:13-14 and verse 22-24. We must learn even from Isaac too.<br /><br />
How much can you give back to God who has graciously given you all things? We must think the way Abraham thought. It was God that gave Isaac, so if He requested for what He gave to a man. That man should willingly give it back to Him. Many of us struggle with God and we seem to place a limit upon what we can give to Him. The more we love, the more we give. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
