            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Acts 5:17-29 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Matt. 11:12</strong> <br>                         
And from the days of
John the Baptist until
now the kingdom of
heaven suffereth
violence, and the
violent take it by
force.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				The kingdom of God has never expanded on earth through ease. Therefore, those who are committed to the expansion of the kingdom must be ready to face opposition and persecution. Our Lord Jesus told us that we shall be hated for following the Way. He said that satanic elements would derive happiness from spilling our blood. Today, the children of the bondwoman have let hell loose all over the world their orgy of violence by
the mandate of their master, the devil. History has never witnessed such a high rate of senseless killings and the slaughtering of fellow human beings like goats, across the globe. It is in the midst of all these that the kingdom of God must still gain advancement. Therefore, you must get ready to be violent.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				However, we must understand exactly what Jesus Christ was saying in John 11:12 (our memory verse). The violence He spoke of is the violence of resistance to the forces that want us to be cowed and intimidated by the fear they create as they unleash terror. It is the violence of tenacity of holding fast to our faith in Christ when we are confronted and threatened with death unless we denounce Christ and turn away from Him. That is what I mean by being in combat rather than seeking comfort. Christians who want to remain in their comfort zone may not make marks in the end-time. To be combative is to be assertive. It is to proclaim the good news without fear and to stand on whatever the word of God has declared as the truth. We must rise up to uphold the word of God in whatever it condemns, the stand of government notwithstanding. No government on earth can help anyone to get to heaven and that is not their business. So, the church must stand against all legislation that is anti-Bible. Any pastor who approves what God condemns is on the way to hell. That is what the Bible says.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The violence of the Spirit which we require is to be ready to die for what we believe and that is not comfortable at all. We can all remember the words of Martin Luther king Jnr. He said that <b>a man who has not found a cause for which he is prepared to die is not fit to live.</b> This end-time requires combative, not comfortable Christianity. Rejoice in the Lord.
