            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Isaiah 53:5 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Exo. 23:25</strong> <br>                         
And ye shall serve the
LORD your God, and he
shall bless thy bread,
and thy water; and I will
take sickness away from
the midst of thee.</code></pre>

				<p>
				We are still considering the mind of Jesus. This is necessary because every believer must know the mind of God towards him so that he can know what the will of God is for him and appreciate when it is the enemy that initiates attacks against him for God cannot be tempted with evil. For example, God is not the author of sickness. Jesus Christ came
to heal the sick. We referred to Luke 4:18 yesterday as enfolding the kingdom agenda which Christ came to pursue on the earth. The healing of all sicknesses is cardinal on the agenda.

				</p>
				
				<p>
				We shall consider the subject of healing and health today as the fifth supernatural exchange that took place on the cross. He exchanged sickness with total health on the cross and you can receive your healing as you read through this piece today, tomorrow and may be the day after. I must begin by saying that the first law of healing is that you must never believe that God desires that you get sick. Never should you find any justification for sickness in view of the work which Jesus Christ went to do at Calvary. Cast your mind back to the pains Jesus endured on the cross-the lashes, the bruises, the piercing of His side with the sword, the crown of thorns on His head, the jeering by the hostile Roman soldiers, the vinegar that He tasted, the excruciating pains of the cross and so on. All those torture was partly to obtain total health for you. I have made a case for the truth that the plan of God for the believer is not just to get healed but to enjoy total health. Jesus Christ died to make you whole as a child of God. Wholeness or total health is superior to healing and by faith (which is the scriptural ingredient for healings) and you can migrate from seeking healing from time to time and enter into the reality of total health. You can stay healthy by the reason of the work of Christ at Calvary. The desire of Jesus is to make you whole permanently, not momentarily.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Our memory verse for today says that God will take sickness away from our midst. My take is that if God takes away something, then it no longer exists. Therefore through spiritual battle I can declare war against what God says He has taken away and which Satan wants to reintroduce through his cunning devises. One of such devises is the manipulation of the human mind to accept the reality of what is contrary to the word of God. It takes a blind man to see what has been taken away. Refuse to see sickness or any kind of infirmity. Jesus Christ says it is unto you according to your faith. (Matthew 9:29). Rejoice in the Lord.
