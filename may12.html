But without faith it 
is impossible to please 
him: for he that cometh 
to God must believe 
that he is, and that 
he is a rewarder of 
them that diligently 
seek him.</code></pre>

				<p>
				The issue we considered yesterday has necessitated our consideration of a closely related one today. God does not prove Himself to everyone who calls Him Lord. He says in His word that it is not all who call Him Lord that will see His face in heaven. Why? This is because many people who call His name with their mouths have no relationship with Him. Christianity is much more of relationship than it is of religion. Anyone could be religious but
only a few have a relationship with God. His word tells us that we can only have a relationship with Him through Christ. Only those who are washed by the blood of Jesus and have their sins cleansed are His children by adoption. We don’t belong to God by religion but by relationship.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The pit and substance of today’s message is that until you belong to God through the spiritual rebirth or regeneration which is also referred to as redemption, you cannot authentically believe in Him. To belong to God is more important than to merely believe in Him. In short, belonging is superior to believing. The reason why people call on God and may not receive an answer is because they do not belong to Him. In 2 Timothy 2:19, the scripture makes this clarification: thus “Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, the Lord knoweth them that are His. And, let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.” Our God is not an ‘anyhow’ God. We cannot fool Him by the camouflage of religion. He knows those that belong to Him and He responds to the faith of such people. Faith is impotent in the absence of a relationship with God.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Many people find it difficult to trust God for divine intervention even after they have prayed. Trust is established upon a solid relationship. Indeed, when you have a solid relationship with God, your prayers may be fewer but you may be getting bigger results. This is because, at the level of deep trust between you and God, when He trusts you and you trust in Him just like Abraham, He will even respond to your trust in Him just like He did to Abraham; He will respond to your heart before you pray with your mouth! See Isaiah 65:24.<br />< br />
				
				Do you desire a more rewarding relationship with God? You must believe that He is the God who wants to be the Lord over all areas of your life. He is the El–Shaddai (Almighty) but He wants to be Adonai (owner) of your life. Will you let Him? You can start today. He has been waiting for you. Rejoice in the Lord.
