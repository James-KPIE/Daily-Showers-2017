				Two days ago, I explained that God is simple and that when we understand His simplicity, life becomes better for us. In the Old Testament people called on the name of Jehovah to deliver them. They groaned before God, in so doing they expressed their worries and laid their complaints before Him. For example, the children of Israel cried to the Lord at the height of their oppression during their Egyptian slavery. God remembered Abraham and answered their cry and came to
deliver them. Much later, Elisha called on the God of Elijah at the bank of river Jordan and the Lord responded by parting the water for his passage. The Son of God was not yet made manifest at those times but when He came, the whole story changed. He came and gave us His name as a power of attorney, to lay claim to the power of God in response to our needs.<br /><br />
Today, it is fashionable in different places to pray in the name of Jesus and add something else to it, such as ‘fire.’ May be some Christians received that as a revelation. Fire is a symbol of the Holy Spirit, so it may be conceded as okay. In some cases, we may be asked to call that name of Jesus three or seven times. I do not know the reason why. Is the name not strong enough when we call it only once? Our Lord only said we should ask for anything in His name. So, we simply offer our prayers and send it by the name of Jesus to carry His authority. Situations and circumstances, demons and principalities bow at the mention of this great name when a child of God calls the name of Jesus. The efficacy of the name of Jesus does not depend on how many times we call the name. Some people are also in the fashion of calling to the God of prophet or pastor this or that. Maybe that is an extension of calling on the God of Elijah. That one may not be out of place, but Jesus Christ said if you shall ask the Father anything in His name, He will do it.<br /><br />
Let us keep simple what the Lord has made simple. We don’t need to create our own logic by making a doctrine out of a once and for all event in the Bible. We only need the name of Jesus. We don’t need to call on Him through the name of His mother. She came for an assignment, finished it and she is gone forever. Glory be to God for the role Mary played. The name of Jesus is enough. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
