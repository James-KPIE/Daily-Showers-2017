            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Exodus 1:6-14 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Exo. 1:11</strong> <br>                         
Therefore they did set over 
them taskmasters to afflict 
them with their burdens. 
And they built for Pharaoh 
treasure cities, Pithom 
and Raamses.</code></pre>

				<p>
				Taskmasters are arresters of destiny because they make you to work without making personal progress. The story of the Israelites in Egypt started on a pleasant note because of the influence of Joseph who brought the Israelites in to sojourn there with the permission of Pharaoh who reigned when he was the prime minister. The Jews waxed stronger and flourished because they were covenant carriers.
The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob prospered them and they grew in population as they grew in wealth. Then a new king emerged in Egypt who did not know Joseph and he became envious of the Israelites. He openly complained that the Israelites were mightier than the Egyptians and he came up with strategies to weaken and demoralize them. His tools were political domination, economic exploitation, social degradation and cultural subjugation. The Israelites were practically turned into slaves.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The hardship of the Israelites was not to be forever because their whole experience was already captured in prophecy. (See Genesis 15:13). In Exodus 2:24-25, we read that God heard their groaning and He remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob and God looked upon the children of Israel and had respect unto them. In other words He heard their prayers. The Lord then set in motion the process for their liberation and appointed Moses as the captain for their deliverance. The rest is history. The Israelites left Egypt richer than they had been under the oppression. They obtained freedom from the taskmasters and those who had arrested their destiny.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob is still on the throne. He is the same yesterday and today and forever. Maybe your case is similar to that of the Israelites when they were under the taskmasters. God can deliver you and set your destiny on the path of progress. There are spiritual taskmasters. They are forces which make you to labour so much with very little to show for it. There are people who work longer hours and earn so little unlike those who work few hours and earn so much more. We know that the acquired skills of individuals may be responsible for this but there are highly skilled people who have nothing to show for their labour. Many people work but those who engage them don’t want to pay them. That is the work of spiritual taskmaster. You need to desperately and frantically call on God for your deliverance and He will deliver you. Arise and pray. Don’t just look on. Contend with the taskmasters. Rejoice in the Lord.
