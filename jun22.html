				Supernatural intervention is a possibility for the covenant children who get connected to vessels of God who carry the anointing. Ministering to higher vessels creates access to different kinds of blessings. In 2 Kings 4:8-17, grace inspired the
Shunnamite woman to begin to minister to Elisha. Little did she know that in her season of need, her deeds would provoke divine intervention. Through Elisha’s ministry, the barrenness of the woman was terminated. As her son grew, the boy died of headache one day and the woman went to the field to locate Elisha. Until she got to Elisha she told everyone who asked her what her problem was, that, all was well. She did not disclose her problem to anyone because she knew where she would get the solution and she got her reprieve as Elisha later raised the boy from death by the power of God in him.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				In 2 Kings 8:1-8, a heavenly information was leaked to the same woman alone by the prophet to whom she had ministered with her substance. She was told of an imminent famine and she was advised to relocate elsewhere for the seven years the famine would last. And she did. At the end of the famine, she returned to her native land and, by her connection with Elisha the prophet, she got her land restored to her together with the proceeds from the land for the seven years when she was out of town. The anointing which you respect, and especially the anointing of the man of God to whom you minister in substance, will always be available to help you in the time of need.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				I have been privileged to minister in substance to different men of God and the words they have spoken into my life keep working till tomorrow. It is such a privilege in redemption to be connected to a higher grace and to flow with it. I have also been blessed greatly by men and women who I have been privileged to connect with and to whom I have had cause to minister too. They have fulfilled Romans 15:27 and Galatians 6:6 in practical terms, across the globe. May God bless them all.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Don’t die a loner. Don’t keep suffering because of selfishness. Every king needs a prophet. Locate one of the higher vessels with a proven ministry and set a covenant covering for your destiny. You will not die helpless. Rejoice in the Lord.
