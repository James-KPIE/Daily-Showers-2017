And he said unto them, 
Why are ye so fearful? 
how is it that ye 
have no faith?</code></pre>

				Those who engage in authentic worship easily obtain access to God’s presence and His blessings. Worship is an act of submission to the supremacy, majesty and sovereignty of God. We worship Him for His attributes and praise Him for His acts. Even when we have not received our petitions from the Lord, our
understanding of who God is will always cause us to worship Him. The Bible says that Abraham did not stagger in faith while waiting for the performance of God’s promise but he was giving glory to God (Romans 4:20-22).
				</p>
				
				<p>
				As we shall see in the next few days, the act of worship gives us access to all manners of blessings. There is no person who engaged in true worship in the Bible that did not provoke Jesus Christ to do a miracle or answer his or her prayers. Heaven can be motivated to release a blessing to us because of our genuine act of worship. The leprous man was not supposed to be attended to by our Lord Jesus Christ. He was an outcast who should not be in town, under the law of Moses. Under that law, whoever touched him was also unclean. Yet, on that day he approached Jesus Christ and before anyone could raise a sustainable objection on the ground of the law, he went on his knees before Jesus Christ and that was it–the law concerning the leprous was set aside. Jesus Christ gave him attention and his act of worship washed his leprosy away. Of course, the role of grace was very obvious in the scenario. <b>Grace will qualify the worst person where the law has disqualified the best.</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				True worshippers get their miracles much more easily. As we observed yesterday, worship acknowledges who God is. Beyond that, worship exalts God above all and celebrates His reliability in His commitment to the reality of the unseen. As we shall see tomorrow, worship is a booster of faith. You cannot engage in deep authentic worship without entering into the spirit realm, and faith is spirit. Worship “maximizes” God and minimizes challenges. Worship helps you to want more and more of God. In the depth of worship, you enter into the realm of possibilities and you will suddenly find burdens lifted while the joy of His presence fills your heart. You can begin to engage in authentic worship today. Rejoice in the Lord.
