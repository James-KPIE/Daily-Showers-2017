            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: 2 Tim. 2:1-13 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Acts 16:26</strong> <br>                         
And suddenly there was a 
great earthquake, so that 
the foundations of the 
prison were shaken: and 
immediately all the doors 
were opened, and every 
one's bands were loosed.</code></pre>

				We have seen the unlimited expression of God’s power in bringing solutions to our problems. God is at liberty to use anything to solve any problem and we must open our hearts to Him by faith without placing a limitation on how God should move in our lives and situations either through unbelief or through negative mentality. He can decide to use different means to accomplish different purposes. In Acts 12:1-11, we read of the deliverance of Peter from the prison after Herod had
kept him in prison custody as he planned to exterminate him. In our Bible reading for today, we find our sovereign God using another means to work out the deliverance of His servants from the prison.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Paul and Silas had been used mightily to deliver a young girl who was being used to make money by her master through the satanic spirit of fortune–telling. Apparently angered by this development, her owner had instigated the arrest of Paul and Silas and stirred up riots in the city in order to blackmail the disciples and they succeeded in their plot. That was what led to the jailing of Paul and Silas. The duo were not dampened in their spirit and while they were securely chained in their prison room, they found the expression of unity of faith by which they praised God by singing psalms. As they engaged this weapon (praise is a weapon of deliverance), the Almighty God moved in heaven and He sent an earthquake that shook the prison so much that the chains fell off from Paul and Silas. The jailer became afraid and Paul had to calm him down and persuaded him not to injure himself. He probably would have committed suicide to avoid the capital punishment.
				</p>
				
				<p>	
Whenever our Almighty Father organizes a shaking, something miraculous is on the way. In Ezekiel 37, when the Lord asked Ezekiel to speak life to dry bones, there was a shaking. It was after the shaking that the dry bones came together by themselves. In Psalm 68:1, the Bible says the Lord will arise and His enemies shall be scattered. Whenever God arises in heaven there will be a shaking on the earth because the earth is His footstool. May God arise on your behalf and cause a shaking for your help, in Jesus name. Rejoice in the Lord.
