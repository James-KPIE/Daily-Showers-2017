I can do all things through 
Christ which strengtheneth me.</code></pre>

				<p>
				Past performance can become an idol to us. It is possible to dwell on the achievement of yesteryears until the present does not task us and until the future evaporates from our hands, God forbid. Many of us have the natural tendency to keep celebrating
our past achievements without challenging ourselves to new strides in whatever the area of our calling is. Apostle Paul counsels us not to remain in our yesterday because <b>there is no future in the past.</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We must set new goals for ourselves when we have achieved the last one. That is why our goals must be time–bound and measureable, although they must not be unreasonable. To live without goals is to live carelessly because without goals you will lack the optimal usage of time and resources. As a matter of personal experience, I discovered that when you have a project as a goal to be achieved, your resources are channeled to such a project constantly and it blocks the avenues of wasteful and careless spending. Sometimes, before anyone knows that you have some money, it goes into the project. Through that orientation you can achieve a great objective with little streams of income. On the other hand, if you have no project into which you direct your funds as they come in, your life will fulfill the scripture that says that when money increases, so are the things that eat up the money. May you not be financially careless. That is talking about having some goals ahead into which you channel your resources, each time. That is one way to get ahead of yesterday. It makes for an engaged and profitable life.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We must invest in our future every day. The things we do today are the indicators of what the future will yield to us. Wise people make sure that they don’t stay idle. They desire to move from one level of usefulness to another. Anytime we pause to stay with our past performance, we are working towards stagnation. Paul was an exceptional missionary. He went from one city to the other around Asia and he was planting churches. He worked tirelessly to the end because, as soon as he did what the Lord would have him do in a city, he moved on to another. Therefore, he did not fall into the trap of the idol of past achievement. Arise and lay hand on something new. Dare to move into a more audacious adventure then, you will not rest in the past. Rejoice in the Lord.
