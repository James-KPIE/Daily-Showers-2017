            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Eccl. 5:6</strong> <br>                         
Suffer not thy mouth
to cause thy flesh to
sin; neither say thou
before the angel, that
it was an error:
wherefore should
God be angry at thy
voice, and destroy the
work of thine hands?</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
					Just as the power of ‘one speech’ can take someone to the throne; a negative speech or an offensive speech can dethrone a king or hinder a destiny. By the words that a man speaks, he can raise himself or ruin his own life. Careless speaking can be very costly as the case of Herod shows in our Bible passage for today. It was the undeserved glory which the subjects of King Herod
ascribed to him that put him in trouble. When the people
hailed his oration as that of the gods they were indirectly telling him that he was a deity. Rather than reject such an accolade, the king appeared to have consented to and approved of it, so, an angel struck him and he died.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					It was king Nebuchadnezzar who used his own tongue to bring evil upon himself when he arrogated to himself the credit for building his sprawling palace. He did not remember God. His punishment was that his skin became like that of an animal and he spent the next seven years in the bush like an animal. He learnt his lesson the bitter way. At the end of his punishments he began to proclaim that God is the Ruler of all the kingdoms of the earth and that He gives the kingdom to whomsoever He would (Daniel 4:17,25). One careless speech can spell doom in a man’s life.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					A similar case to that of King Herod was the praise that the women in Israel showered on David after he conquered Goliath. They sang that Saul had killed his thousands while David had killed his ten thousands. Saul was infuriated by the analogy and he grew so bitter as a result and in his anger, he attempted to kill David several times. Saul allowed the song of those women to destroy his destiny. He eventually lost the throne. He should have learnt from the story of Pharaoh and Joseph. Rather than become envious of Joseph, Pharaoh acknowledged the great gift in the young man and created room for the expression of the gift. Pharaoh was reigning and Joseph was ruling and everybody in and outside Egypt was the better for it. Watch out for the one speech from you or that which is made to you and be careful. Rejoice in the Lord.
