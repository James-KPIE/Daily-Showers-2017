            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: 2 Sam. 24:11-25 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: 2 Sam. 24:24</strong> <br>                         
And the king said unto 
Araunah, Nay; but I will 
surely buy it of thee at 
a price: neither will I 
offer burnt offerings unto 
the LORD my God of that 
which doth cost me nothing. 
So David bought the threshing 
floor and the oxen for fifty 
shekels of silver.</code></pre>

				<p>
				A sacrifice is an offering which we give at a great cost to God. It is so called because the person who gives it feels the impact of the denial and the effect on the giver may linger for sometime. For example, when a family gives their only car for a kingdom purpose, that is not an offering but a sacrifice. On the other hand, a gift will not amount to a sacrifice if the family gives one out of their five cars. They would hardly feel it. An offering can also be explained to mean the giving of an egg which a fowl
lays, whereas if the whole fowl is given away, that would be a sacrifice. The determining factor is the cost of what is given to the person who gives it.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				David’s experience shows that heaven can be provoked for supernatural intervention when we put a sacrifice on the altar for that purpose. David had prayed and fasted to avert the punishment which the Lord had sent because of the unauthorized census which he carried out in Israel and Judah. The three options which the Lord put before David were all terrible. Who will choose one of those (verse 13)? So David opted for the mercy of God, yet, his appeal did not appease God’s anger. Then, he received an instruction from his seer to raise an altar of sacrifice. Araunah’s threshing floor was the choice place to rear an altar unto the Lord. This was the only way out of the crises which David had brought upon his nation and he was ready to pay whatever the cost would be. Therefore, he insisted he would pay for the threshing floor and he did for fifty shekels of silver.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				A sacrifice is also called a tearful seed, an expression used for the pain of parting with the sacrifice. Placing a sacrifice before the Lord to avert evil or to cancel a curse or to terminate a drought is wisdom because it expresses our faith in the power of God to intervene in our situation and give us a change of story. No one can buy a miracle from God but we can sow our seed and believe in God for His intervention for a breakthrough, healing or deliverance. When Peter yielded his boat for Jesus’ use after a night of fishing without catching fish, there was a dramatic turnaround. The widow’s last meal was a sacrifice in 1 Kings 17:8-16 and it provoked heaven for a release of supernatural supplies. We can stand on God’s testimony in His word to seek divine intervention. Rejoice in the Lord.
