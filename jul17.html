            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: John 11:40</strong> <br>                         
Jesus saith unto her, Said 
I not unto thee, that, if 
thou wouldest believe, 
thou shouldest see 
the glory of God?</code></pre>

				<p>
				<b>Faith is taking God by His word.</b> Faith is accepting scriptural responsibility for the performance of what God has promised. Faith is obeying God to commit God to perform what He has said. Faith is taking steps to actualize the living word of God. Everything God has promised to do in and for the believer
is at the mercy of faith. As a believer, divine prerogative has elected you to be among the blessed but without faith you cannot lay hold on your heritage in Christ and your heritage of wellness in all areas is included.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Audacious faith is required for your breakthrough from illness to wholeness. You must not be satisfied with healing from time to time when the Lord can make you whole and make your body to become immune to sicknesses. That same level of faith is also required to climb from the level of begging and borrowing and stay at the corridor of a lack–free, debt–free life where you can continue to provide succour for other people.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Whatever the word of God has said you are, you can actualize by faith. You can have whatever His word says you have been given through faith. You can also become the person you are called to be in redemption by the exercise of faith. <b>You see, everything that answers to God answers to faith.</b> Check two scriptures and you will confirm this truth–Luke 1:37 and Mark 9:23. All things are possible to God and to the man who believes in this great and awesome God of ours. That takes us back to the first sentence of this exhortation–faith takes God by His word.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				When you read the word of God and find a good prospect for your life and destiny, that is your revelation. What you need to do is hold unto it and refuse to let it go and if anything comes to your hearing to the contrary, you reject it automatically. If it is a negative thought, you speak contrary to it on the spot. Faith is spirit and you must never let it ‘fly’ away. It is the anchor of your destiny in Christ. It is the currency by which all spiritual businesses are transacted. It is by faith we are saved (Ephesians 2:8), by faith we stand (2 Corinthians 1:24), by faith we are justified (Romans 5:1), by faith we walk (2 Corinthians 5:7), we prosper by faith and we are established by faith (2 Chronicles 20:20), we are healed by faith (Matthew 9:22 and 29) and by faith we see the glory of God (John11:40). Won’t you rather grow your faith? Rejoice in the Lord.
