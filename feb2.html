							<h1>MORE BLESSED TO GIVE</h1>

							<!-- Text -->
								<section>
									<h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>							<h4 align="right">Thu. Feb. 2, 2017</h4>
									
									<h3 style=color:red>Daily Reading: Luke 6:30-38 </h3>
									<pre><code> <b style=color:red>M.V: Acts 20:35(b)</b> <br />                         
It is more blessed to
give than to receive.</code></pre> 

									<p>
Our late papa and inspirational leader, a trail-blazer in the school of faith by the name Oral Roberts opened my eyes of
understanding to the true interpretation of our memory verse for today, many years ago. While he was teaching on the “thousand fold returns,” he said the meaning of that sentence is that it is much more productive to give than to receive and I blessed God for the teaching. This little explanation will shed more light on my submission in yesterday’s piece where I opined that we can change our prayer from ‘God bless me’ to ‘God make a blessing.’
									
									</p>
									<p>
Most times, a person who prays ‘God bless’ me all the time consigns himself to the ‘give-me’ corner and if it appears no one is in sight to bless him or blessings are not flowing constantly to him, his faith may grow cold and he may become irritable and may soon begin to discredit the people in the church where he worships as loveless and uncaring. I have seen people like that before. They come to a church and expect that the church will carry all their burden, give them food, fix their accommodation and pay their children’s school fees. Things don’t work that way. The church can only go so far in view of the several needs of other people which stretch the resources of the church.
									</p>
									<p>
The prayer ‘God make me a blessing’ can really change your life if you pray it candidly and begin to live according to your prayer. You live according to your prayer when your mentality aligns with the desire for which you pray. You now go about with the mentality of one who wants to give to someone in kind or in prayer or lend a helping hand, not necessarily in monetary terms all the time. You, thereby, lift yourself up from the obsession of always wanting from other people. Giving is the best proof of love and it can be in any form. When you operate from that understanding, the siege of lack and want begin to shift from your own head and very soon, the siege will be over. Please take this to heart and begin to practise it.									
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Don’t box yourself in to a corner. God, who is over all, is good to all. I will share some personal experiences tomorrow and I beg you not to see it as pride on my part. It is the testimony of what God taught me on this vital subject. Rejoice in the Lord.
									</p>
