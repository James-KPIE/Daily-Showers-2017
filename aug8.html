            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: John 1:6-13 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: John 1:7</strong> <br>                         
The same came for a
witness, to bear
witness of the Light,
that all men through
him might believe.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>Jesus Christ is the true light. Anyone who has studied World religion would know that many people have come to the world as self-proclaimed light bearers but they had no light in them. Some of them came with philosophies that were witty and many people fell for them and subscribed
to their ways as their followers. Some of them have large followers but that in itself does not authenticate any claim that they carry the light of God. The true light is the light that exposes the world of darkness and liberates souls from the darkness. The outcome is called transformation. The blood of Jesus Christ is the sole spiritual detergent that washes a man’s heart clean of sin and justifies a man from the sentence of sin. And it is by His name alone that man can be saved.
<br /><br />
Jesus Christ came as the Saviour to the whole world irrespective of the religion to which a man belongs. Many of those who are saved today belonged to the Christian religion before we were saved. A good number of us were born into Christian families where no one was saved until Jesus, the true Light started to beam His light into our families and one person responded to the light and told the rest through evangelism and personal witnessing. Salvation is personal. Each person must personally admit the fact of his sin, acknowledge his helplessness to overcome sin, and turn to Christ in repentance and be saved.

				</p>
				
				<p>
				Jesus Christ is the only One who has claimed with all proofs that He came from God the Father. All the other religious leaders and philosophers over the ages, came from this earth. They have their source in their earthly parents. However, our Lord Jesus, even though He was born as a man, He was born by the conception of the Holy Ghost. Others were born by the seed of man but our Lord Jesus was born by the seed of the Word. That is why He is called the Word. He was not and is not a religious leader because He did not come to establish any religion. His kingdom mandate was specifically stated in Luke 4:18 and there is no single reference to the establishment of any religion in that mandate.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				It must also be emphasized that Jesus Christ is the Creator of all those who appeared on the surface of this earth and laid claim to being spiritual leaders. He is the One that gave life to them all (see John 1:1-4). The Creator can never be in the same rank as the created. Rejoice in the Lord.
