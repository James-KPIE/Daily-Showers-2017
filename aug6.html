            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: John 15:16</strong> <br>                         
Ye have not chosen
me, but I have chosen
you, and ordained
you, that ye should go
and bring forth fruit,
and that your fruit
should remain: that
whatsoever ye shall
ask of the Father in
my name, he may
give it you.</code></pre>

				<p>
				Progressive Christianity is measured by our unceasing love for God and people. However blessed we may be materially, if we are barren in bringing souls to God’s kingdom, we are risking appearing before our Maker empty-handed, God forbid! Soul-winning is our first and foremost assignment as believers. Whoever loves God must love souls. The reason why God sent His only begotten Son into this sinful world was to redeem the souls of men and women who had been trapped in sin by the fall of Adam and Eve in the
Garden of Eden. That is why Romans 3:23 says that all have sinned (in Adam) and fallen short of the glory of God. The purpose of redemption is to restore the original glory of God which rested upon man as an expression of being created in God’s image. That image was dented by sin and man lost the glory when sin came into his life.
				</p>
				
				<p>It is our inescapable responsibility as children of God to get involved in sharing the good news so that other sinners can taste what we have tasted in Jesus Christ through the redemption which we have received by the blood which He shed on the cross at Calvary. We should continually invite people to come and have a taste of the goodness which salvation offers (Psalm 34:8). It was the burden in the heart of the apostle Paul that we be fruitful in every good work, and increase in the knowledge of God, according to Colossians 1:10. The work of spreading the goodnews is a good work. The greatest experience a man can have on earth is the regeneration experience. Transformation from the sinful life to a holy life is the greatest miracle a man can obtain from God. What a joy it would be for you to participate in making the greatest miracle happen on earth from time to time.
				</p>
				
				<p>The primary purpose for receiving the power of the Holy Spirit is also to engage in the rescue of the souls of sinners and turn them back from going to hell. No man is good enough to make heaven unless he is saved by the blood of Jesus. There is no access to heaven through any religion. Jesus is the Way that goes to the Father. There is no salvation in any other name. (John 14:6 and Acts 4:12,10:43). Enrol with the kingdom evangelists today and let your life begin to count for the kingdom. You cannot afford to remain unfruitful. Rejoice in the Lord.
