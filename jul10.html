            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: 2 Chronicles 20:1-12 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Ps. 119:111</strong> <br>                         
Thy testimonies have I taken 
as an heritage for ever: for 
they are the rejoicing of 
my heart.</code></pre>

				<p>
				The testimonies of the Lord’s great doings at the time God created the earth and through the ages are a part of our heritage in Christ. The testimonies are the bedrock of our confidence whenever we step out in faith to defend our
heritage in Christ. We can call to mind what the Lord did in the past and boast in the confidence that our God is capable of doing again whatever He did before. It is not for fun that Hebrews 13:8 (which is the motto for some Pentecostal Movements) declares that “Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today and forever.” Only those who belong to Christ can place their reliance on the testimonies of God in their quest to obtain victory and blessings whenever they desire them.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We shall consider the stories of David, Elijah and Jehoshaphat today and see the role of testimonies in their preparation to face the enemies in the battles that they fought.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				David had gone to King Saul for final briefing as we read yesterday, before he squared up with Goliath in the epic battle–by–proxy between the Philistines and Israel. David was not a war veteran like Goliath but he had his confidence built on the testimonies of how the Lord had empowered him to kill both the lion and the bear. He trusted, therefore, in the ability of God to do what He had done before and God did exactly that. In the case of Elijah, he started by worshipping the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. When he did so, as he was preparing to confront the prophets of Baal on mountain Carmel, he was calling to heart that the God of Abraham is the covenant–keeping God, that the God of Isaac is the God of new beginning and that the God of Jacob is the God of multiplication. This God has been faithful from generation to generation and Elijah was persuaded that He would yet be faithful again. And the Lord proved Himself on Mount Carmel!
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Jehoshaphat was set to defend the heritage of Judah, a people of God. He took his time in the temple to reel out the history of God’s faithfulness in preserving the heritage of His people right from the time of Abraham. He rested his case on the testimonies of the Lord over the ages and the Lord responded to his submission of the Lord’s ability to deliver His people. He won the battle for Judah. You can win your battles by making God’s testimonies your heritage. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
