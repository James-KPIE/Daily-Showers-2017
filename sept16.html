For verily I say unto you, 
That whosoever shall say 
unto this mountain, Be 
thou removed, and be thou 
cast into the sea; and 
shall not doubt in his 
heart, but shall believe 
that those things which he 
saith shall come to pass; 
he shall have whatsoever 
he saith.</code></pre>

				God often allows us to participate in the process that leads to the solution to our problems. This happens when we put faith into action. Most often, we need to cooperate with God for the manifestation of the miraculous in our lives. This is where faith becomes essential. In Mark 6:5-6 the Bible tells us that Jesus could not perform a miracle in Nazareth, His hometown because of their unbelief. In our Bible passage for today the ruler had faith that the authority and power of our Lord Jesus could reach his servant girl who was about to die back at home and he told Jesus Christ not to bother to go to his house. Our Lord commended his faith.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<b>Faith is absolute confidence in the supernatural ability of God based on a covenant relationship.</b> Those of us who are born again have no reason not to believe in God for the miraculous because faith is the common denominator in every transaction in the kingdom. We are saved by faith. We stand by faith. We are established by faith and we walk by faith. We do everything by faith. God’s power does not change. It is constant. It cannot be upgraded. It is our faith that we should work on, from time to time. To experience solutions to challenges that are tough, we need to increase our faith. Our Lord Jesus healed the ruler’s servant girl who was dying. By the same power, He raised the dead son of the widow of Nain in the same chapter. This time around, pall bearers were carrying the body of the boy to the grave to be buried outside the city. Jesus did not have to increase His power to do that. In John 11:41-44 Jesus Christ raised Lazarus who was dead and had been buried for four days. The dying, the dead and the buried all came back to full life by God’s miracle working power. Jesus Christ could handle all of that because He is the resurrection and the life.
				</p>
				
				<p>	
We need to grow our faith in proportion to our needs. Since faith is in categories, we can aspire to grow our faith from little faith to great faith and to exceeding great faith. When we are faced with greater challenges we must upgrade our faith through proper dieting in God’s word and especially by meditating on the great works the Lord has done. Every testimony is God’s word in action and it is also a prophecy. When we strengthen our faith and it grows, we can partner with God to get solutions to bigger challenges. Rejoice in the Lord.
