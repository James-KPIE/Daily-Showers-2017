And God opened her eyes, 
and she saw a well of water; 
and she went, and filled 
the bottle with water, and 
gave the lad drink.</code></pre>

				Today is a day that is set aside intentionally to remember mothers. The purpose of this message is to bring commendation to those mothers who have endured hardship in different areas in order to give life and succour to their children. There are countless mothers in this class all over Africa. In the message for the fathers’ day last year, I took a swipe at irresponsible fathers
who were only ready to father children without any intention to accept the responsibilities of fatherhood. At the receiving end of such anti–social behaviour are women who became victims of deceit and wickedness in the hands of men who will have children but abdicate the responsibility for the upkeep, welfare and education of the innocent children.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Ishmael was a victim of circumstances. The poor boy was brought into this world outside the will of God for Abraham. When Abraham sent the boy and his mother out of the house, there was little for the sustenance of the boy and the mother on their journey to nowhere. The mother stayed with the boy as he was dying of starvation. She would not walk away and leave the boy to die. While she turned her eyes away in tears, waiting for the final moment when the boy would give up the ghost, God did a miracle. Ishmael later fulfilled the prophecy from God that he would become a nation. In a dramatic twist of fate, Ishmael became the father of the Ishmaelites who became rich enough to buy slaves. They bought Joseph, the grandson of Isaac as a slave, from Joseph’s brothers.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We remember today those pioneering mothers like the mothers of John and Charles Wesley and Curtis and Ben Carson. The mother of the Carsons particularly gave all she had to ensure that her children had education. When she could not afford to purchase books for the two sons, she sent them to read books in the public library. Her doggedness saw the two boys to enviable heights in engineering and medicine. Ben Carson was one of the Republican candidates for the highest office of the President of the United States of America during the last presidential elections in the U. S. We salute all those courageous mothers in the world today.
				
				<br /><br />
				
				To all young mothers who have suddenly found themselves bearing the responsibilities of both parents with regard to their children, may the Lord grant them grace and reward their efforts with great children. Amen. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
