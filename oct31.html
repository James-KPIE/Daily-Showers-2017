            <h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>
            <h4 align="right">Tue. Oct. 31, 2017</h4>
            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Psalm 23 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Pro 18:21</strong> <br>                         
Death and life are in the 
power of the tongue: and 
they that love it shall 
eat the fruit thereof.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				You can harness the power of the tongue to terminate any kind of delay in your life’s experience. Grace taught David to be a good talker and he enjoyed victory upon victory by the use of his tongue. David constantly employed his tongue to worship God, calling God several names that describe who God was to him and the things that God did
in His life. David would wake up in the morning and turn to God in worship saying “I will love Thee O Lord, my strength. The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust, my buckler, and the horn of my salvation and my high tower. I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised; so shall I be saved from my enemies.” (Psalm 18:1-3). When David said that the Lord is worthy to be praised, David was saying that all that he saw was good works of the Lord and the beauty of His holiness. David was simply ‘blinded’ by the goodness of the Lord. He could not see any bad in Him.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				You cannot stop a person like David from being blessed and victorious. The posture of David was that of a person who is constantly meditating on the testimonies of God and who has staked his life and destiny on such testimonies. David became his own prophet and he engaged the weapon of prophecy to create a robust future for himself. Even at tough times (and David had it rough and tough for quite some time), David maintained the same attitude of gratitude to God. He held to the weapon of faith at the most difficult and trying season of his life. In Psalm 27:13, he said “I believe that I will see the Lord’s goodness in the land of the living.” He positioned himself to see the other side of his trials. He was therefore able to declare that “though weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.” Now, imagine that an enemy was rejoicing over David in his moment of sorrow, thinking that David was at his last bus stop and suddenly the enemy heard David screaming those words with hope and enthusiasm. That enemy would feel defeated.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Engage the force of positive confession to bring an end to your delay. Don’t magnify your challenge by constantly dwelling on it or focusing on it. But let your positive confession be built on the word of God. You own ordinary words will lack power but when it is the word of God you confess as it takes root in your heart, then you find that forever the word of God is settled in heaven to change things on the earth. Rejoice in the Lord.
