            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Exodus 15:22-26 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Deut. 7:15</strong> <br>                         
And the LORD will take 
away from thee all sickness, 
and will put none of the 
evil diseases of Egypt, 
which thou knowest, upon 
thee; but will lay them 
upon all them that hate thee.</code></pre>

				<p>
				I will treat this issue again because it is very important for the placement of our faith. Many brethren believe that their portion in Christ is limited to healing. So, they don’t contend against sickness. They admit that no person can probably go without getting sick. They expect sickness to come with the assurance of faith that Jesus would heal them. That is scriptural–Jesus is the healer. If we study the Bible a little
more, we shall find that there is a level of blessing which is higher than
healing. That is the level of a sickness–free life. And many believers are in that category. There are believers who have enjoyed sickness–free lives since they received Jesus Christ as their Lord and Saviour. It is a possibility in redemption.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				As we consider our God as the Giver of permanent solutions, we need to lay emphasis on the possibility which we can all experience as we stand on God’s immutable word. God had just healed the bitter water of Marah and turned it to sweet water. God went further to tell the Israelites that if they would obey Him and keep His commandments diligently, He would not allow any of the diseases which He brought upon the Egyptians to come upon them. In that state they would need healing. You cannot get sick unless a disease comes on you. We can, therefore, place a demand on the promise of God to keep diseases away from us so that we don’t get sick. Let us put it this way–we can move from the minimum (which is healing) to the maximum (which is sickness–free) as both are possibilities in God’s word.
				</p>
				
				<p>	
We can dig deeper in scripture to strengthen our faith on this. In Isaiah 53:5 the Bible says it is by Jesus’ stripe that we are healed. That means the healing is available presently and flowing. In 1 Peter 2:24, the past tense is used. Here the Bible says “by whose stripes you were healed.” This is rendered in the past tense. In other words, your healing was a perfected act on the cross when Jesus paid the price for our salvation and obtained our righteousness. Simultaneously, He also bore the stripes for our healing. So, it is a done deal. We are to enter into the fullness of what Jesus Christ has accomplished on the cross and both salvation and healing were completed there and then. Jack up your faith and move higher on the health ladder from healing unto wholeness where you enjoy a sickness-free life. Rejoice in the Lord.
