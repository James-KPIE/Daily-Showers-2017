            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Acts 18:10</strong> <br>                         
For I am with thee, and
no man shall set on thee
to hurt thee: for I have
much people in this city.</code></pre>

				Every believer is raised as a ‘saviour’ in a sense. We are saved to seek the salvation of those who are lost. These fellows used to be our companions in the world of darkness to which we used to belong, where we carried out the works of darkness as we ran errands for the devil. Many of the early saints prayed for us for our salvation. Our spiritual
fathers and mothers may be from any part of the world. As we also intercede for souls to be saved we also will have many children from afar in the words of Isaiah the prophet.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Yesterday, we saw how God preserved Daniel because he was a kingdom addict. Paul escaped death on many occasions because he was sold out to winning souls for the kingdom. That is the secondary reason why we are saved. First, we are saved to become kingdom citizens who begin to experience eternal life upon our salvation (John 3:16). Secondly, we are saved to join the crusade of those who seek out the lost for their own salvation. God would not allow Paul to die early because he took that assignment very serious and gave all that he had into it. I have asked brethren in some places why they think God should give them long life when their lives don’t count for God. If you pray that God should make you live long and God asks you why He should answer that prayer, what will you tell Him? Recently we began an evangelistic exercise in our church coded ‘Operation 1 for 1.’ Simply, it means that each believer should prayerfully endeavour to bring at least one soul to Jesus (and into the church) in a year. If all believers do so yearly it means we will double the population of believers on the earth yearly. And it is possible. The multitude which are not saved around us are like sheep without shepherd and they are weary (Matthew 9:36).
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Everyone who appreciates this greatest miracle (being saved from sin and hell by the blood of Jesus) will desire that other sinners will be saved too. You see, the world is not safe today because of those who are not saved by the blood of Jesus yet. They are sold out to iniquity and they are helpless. It is God’s will that all shall be saved. We must see every sinner as a potential saint because every saint was formerly a sinner. Rejoice in the Lord.
