            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Heb. 11:32-38 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V Heb. 11:33</strong> <br>                         
Who through faith
subdued kingdoms,
wrought
righteousness,
obtained promises,
stopped the mouths
of lions,</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				It takes violent faith to survive the spiritual holocaust of the end time. As the devil roars around like a lion seeking who he may devour, our faith must be on fire to resist the fiery darts of the wicked. We need the faith of Daniel to say ‘no’ to the delicacy of the idolatrous kings of this world. Do you know that a man’s soul can be afflicted through careless eating and
drinking? A ‘portion’ can be mixed with food for someone and after he has eaten, he will lose his sense of judgment. Men have been ‘raped’ after they slept off suddenly on eating some food carefully laced with some ‘portion’ by desperate women. The reverse is also true as women have been assaulted sexually after some careless eating or drinking.

				</p>
				
				<p>
				We also need the violent faith to stay with God as our source in the day of famine on the earth. Many Christians are weak in this area, especially those who are eager to praise God and celebrate Him when they are surrounded with opulence and not when there is lack or scarcity. Such Christians want to believe God when they see the signs and the wonders and the miracles like Thomas Didymus. However, blessed are those who believe the word which they are told even before the performance of those words. That was the kind of faith which Mary had and it was commended in Luke 1:45. Only Christians who have that kind of faith can look up during famine and declare like David that “The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want” (Psalm 23:1). Such Christians must have also related with God financially, not only spiritually. We grow in the ‘giving’ grace. When we have imbibed the kingdom culture of giving as a spiritual habit, we are blessed and our needs are met even before we ask the Father. God of the harvest is always committed to release the harvest from heaven when the seed leaves our hand on earth. It is only those who have chosen God consciously as their source that can consciously remain unruffled in the season of famine.
				
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Finally for today, we need the violent faith to hold unto the profession of what we believe and whom we have believed – Jesus Christ our Saviour. How many of us are prepared to die rather than renounce Jesus? You don’t know when you will face that question. In the next few years the Europeans will face that question when the sons of the bondwoman take over Europe- no thanks to the influx of millions of them rushing in now because of the war in Syria and other places in the middle-east. America has been naïve enough to say they should come in upon careful screening. How do you screen the DNA of a man with the blood of terrorism? If you are a believer, build your faith now so that you may stand when you are confronted with the option to deny Jesus or be killed. Rejoice in the Lord.
