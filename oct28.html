And said, My Lord, if now 
I have found favour in thy 
sight, pass not away, I 
pray thee, from thy servant.</code></pre>

				Abraham cooperated with God to terminate his delay in having children. And we need to learn from him in this respect. When we emphasize that each believer should live in the consciousness of the reality of our redemption or that our thinking should align with our redemptive reality, we are only advising that our redemption will not be maximally beneficial if we are satisfied with being nominal Christians
alone. The same is true with Holy Ghost baptism which seems so farfetched for many Christians because their ‘religious’ leaders cannot press into it. It was God Himself that inspired the writing of John 3:6, Mark 16:17-18, Matthew 10:7-8 and Luke 11:11-13. A Christian who shuns or ignore the Holy Spirit cannot maximize his or her destiny in Christ.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Abraham was sensitive to God. If he was not, he would have missed Isaac on the day he (Isaac) was delivered to him for a specific time. Until that encounter, the seed of Abraham had only remained in prophecy. Many Christians have heard prophecies that were meant to convey their blessings to them but they missed the blessings because they could not act towards the manifestation due to spiritual insensitivity. How many Christians have remained poor because they could not pick spiritual signals or perceive divine instructions that could have opened the door to their prosperity? God will never come down to load any Christian’s pocket with money. Our bank accounts are not usually filled of strange money sent from heaven. What God does when our prayers move Him is to respond from heaven by placing a demand on us so that we access His supplies when we comply with such instructions.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Some few days ago we commended the faith and sensitivity of the widow of Zarephat for responding positively to the demand of Elijah who requested contrary to all expectations that the poor woman should surrender part of her last meal. What would you have done? Won’t you call Elijah a wicked prophet and send him away? Many of us pray tons of prayers but we are deaf to divine instructions because we have shunned the Holy Spirit. Many Christians who can read and understand the Bible also read it with denominational glasses. Don’t follow your pastor, follow the word of God. Your pastor cannot show to you what he does not see; neither can he give you what he does not have. Abraham had no pastor to follow but only the raw word from God and that was what brought his miracles. We shall continue tomorrow. Every Christian is spiritually dead without the Holy Spirit. It is up to you. You can call on Him in the order of Luke 11:11-13 and He will come to you. Rejoice in the Lord.
