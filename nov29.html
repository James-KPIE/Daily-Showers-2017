            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Psalm 15 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Hab. 1:13</strong> <br>                         
Thou art of purer eyes
than to behold evil, and
canst not look oniniquity:
wherefore lookest thou
upon them that deal
treacherously, and
holdest thy tongue when
the wicked devoureth
the man that is more
righteous than he?</code></pre>

				<p>
				Christ’s mind is pure and undefiled. Evil thoughts and imaginations are far from Him, that is why He said that the prince of this world (the accuser of the brethren) came and found nothing in Him. Our Lord Jesus Christ is pure in His mind because of His holy nature. And that is why Apostle Paul encouraged us to let His mind be in us. His mind was lowly because He is pure. Jesus Christ never exalted Himself while He was here in the body. He would always speak of His Father
and would always take instructions from his Father. He had all the power but He never abused it. At the height of provocation through all manners of insults and derogatory remarks during His trial which was a set-up, He uttered not a word. Our Lord Jesus was calm under provocation. Therefore He did not lose the power of His focus which enabled Him to stay on purpose until His mission on earth was accomplished.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We struggle with many worrisome thoughts because we are still flesh and blood. Thank God that we have the power in the Holy Spirit by the word of life to cast out evil imaginations. Since a man is what he thinks, we must daily sanctify our hearts to remain pure before the Lord. And that is a continuous exercise we must never be tired of carrying out. The reason is simple. As long as we interact with other human fellows, even in the church, offences are inevitable. Many times you will struggle with whether you should revenge or forgive an act of offence against your person. If your heart is not pure you may elect to revenge and if you do you are putting yourself into bondage.
				<br /><br />
				We are daily bombarded with all manners of offensive and corrupting words and pictures on the print and electronic media. The internet is awash with materials that can wreck our souls. The other day a young student followed up some seemingly-harmless mental exercise on the internet until he got to the point where it was suggested to him to commit suicide. Thank God he quickly shut down. Another senior lawyer followed one until he was told to undress himself. It was then he told himself that he is not mad, and he stopped. Immorality is on high scale through internet too. Take heed.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The mind of Christ is a sound mind. It is the Godly mind. It is the unselfish mind. It does not think evil towards other people and it seeks the good of all. You can attain it if you stay with God’s word daily and meditate continually on the word with the determination of faith to remain undefiled. Rejoice in the Lord.
