            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: I Cor. 10:14-17 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: I Cor. 10:17</strong> <br>                         
For we being many are
one bread, and one
body: for we are all
partakers of that one
bread.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				We shall continue along the line of yesterday’s thoughts today as the issue of the power which our unity as members of the body of Christ can generate cannot be overemphasized. When we permit division in the body of Christ, the enemy is happy because the enemy understands
the irresistible power of unity. In Leviticus 26:8, the Bible says <blockquote>“And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.”</blockquote> In our individual units, we are not as powerful as we are when we are together. It is a sin against the Spirit of Christ if anyone promotes disunity among the body of Christ. We shall consider the rewards unity tomorrow but today, we shall look further into the scripture to find our status in the bonding of the body of Christ.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				In Philippians 2:25, we are referred to as fellow-soldiers. That connotes that we have a war we are fighting and which we should fight together against the enemy. The church has only one enemy and that is the devil. We must be careful not to ignorantly fight one another as it has been the case in many instances whereby we have given room to the enemy. In many nations (if not in all) where Christianity is practised by millions of people what we find is the unfortunate situation wherein Christians cannot speak with one voice. Today, in the West and Europe the situation is so hopeless to the point that even so-called Christians don’t know what they believe. It is so terrible to the point that so-called Christians call God a liar and have told God that He did not know what He was doing when He created man and woman distinctly. Every genuine believer must stay with what God has said. Whatever the word of God condemns we cannot approve. We must arise together and fight the common enemy who has sold so many lies which many people have bought to the peril of their soul. We must ponder upon 2 Corinthians 13:8 again and again.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We must be in readiness however to help those who have erred. The Holy Spirit who inspired the writing of His word is ever available to us. Let us pray continually that He will once again draw the confused and deluded ones back into His marvelous light. God is able to engraft the branch into the vine again. He desires the restoration of backsliders and we must never get tired of interceding for them. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
