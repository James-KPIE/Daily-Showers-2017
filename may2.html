            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Ex. 20:5</strong> <br>                         

Thou shalt not bow down 
thyself to them, nor 
serve them: for I the 
LORD thy God am a jealous 
God, visiting the iniquity 
of the fathers upon the 
children unto the third 
and fourth generation of 
them that hate me;</code></pre>

				<p>
				We are created to worship God. Worship is first and foremost a dedication of our hearts unto God. Long before we express our act of worship through singing and dancing, God checks our heart to see the place He occupies there. Since the issues of life flow from the heart, we need to take care of the heart at all times, otherwise, the worship that proceeds from there will be corrupted and therefore, unacceptable to God.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				One of the issues we should watch out for is whether we have idols in our hearts. They are enemies of true worship. And idols are all around us. Money could become our idol if our sleeping and waking thoughts are centred around money. Indeed, many people have equated money with life. It is as if they are dead when they don’t have money. If you find that you are always unhappy and joyless when you don’t have cash or when you are not liquid, then you have a problem. Money is not life. To be broke is good at times. It helps us to turn to our Source once and again. Moreover, we do not need to express everything in terms of money. <b>Our resources are intangible first and if you are rich at that level, the tangible will always show up.</b> I tell brethren not to keep asking for money for everything. God has given houses to people who did not build. He has given cars to people who did not have money, enough, to even buy a tyre. He has filled peoples’ wardrobes when they had no money to buy clothes. Shoes were given to people who had no money to buy them. God has provided food for the hungry when money was scarce. My counsel is that you should always ask for the exact thing you need and not necessarily for money all the time. This approach can take a lot of stress away off you.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				There are other material things that could constitute an idol in the heart. Ornaments such as earrings and other accessories with which the body is decorated have become idols to many people especially ladies. Whatever you cannot afford to look away from, such that when you don’t have it, you feel a sense of being devalued or your social status is being decimated, is probably an idol. Every person who is going to heaven must be able to look away from anything; I mean anything that will perish with this world. That should be our standard as believers in Christ. Rejoice in the Lord.
