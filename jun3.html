				There is a difference between healing and being made whole. Healing simply means an ailment is cured but there may be side-effects or scars. However, to be made whole would be a situation
where there is no re-occurrence of the ailment or even any other
ailment at all. This understanding is crucial because I know believers who have not needed medical attention for close to thirty years or more since they accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord, whereas there are believers who keep receiving healing from time to time for various ailments, either from God or though medication. Wholeness is full restoration of health without a trace of the former ailment.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The leper who was healed and returned to thank Jesus makes this observation very relevant. The man’s faith was expressed in thanksgiving through worship as he fell on his face at the feet of Jesus. As we observed when we started on the series on worship, Jesus Christ found it impossible to resist a man or a woman who worshipped Him. An acknowledgement of the Lordship of Jesus Christ is always a prelude to a desired miracle, if you know how to use the key very well. The few people I know who have enjoyed this <b>wholeness</b> over the decades are real worshippers of God who even go on their knees, unashamed, in the public to worship Jesus. I have said this before that once I was in deep worship of God close to twenty years ago and suddenly I felt that standing was like an affront to the Almighty God. Then, I fell on my knees and yet I felt too tall before Him so, I laid flat on my face on the floor absorbed and engrossed in a life-transforming worship. When God helps you to get to that posture, nothing counts – not your clothing or anything that is of this earth-you just want all of Him as you yield your all unto the Lord of all and the Owner of your life, your husband and the Ruler of your life.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				This exhortation may be a little lesson for those who find it difficult to stay in the Lord’s presence and all they know how to do is ask God for different things. No! if you can have the ‘all’ of God, you already have all things. After all, in Him all things consist. Don’t be too dignified to worship God. Get into deeper worship and access wholeness. Let the supernatural rub off on your personality from time to time and watch how you become too much for the challenges that reduce men to boys. Try it! Worship can make you experience wholeness as a superior blessing to healing. Rejoice in the Lord.
