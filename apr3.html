            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Eze 33:8</strong> <br>                         
When I say unto the wicked, O wicked
man, thou shalt surely die; if thou
dost not speak to warn the wicked
from his way, that wicked man
shall die in his iniquity; but his
blood will I require at thine hand.</code></pre>

					Every believer has been called as a watchman to labour in order to turn sinners away from their iniquity. Unfortunately many Christians are either slow in engaging in the work of evangelism and soul-wining or they are not engaged in it at all. The fearful thing is that God would do just according to His word, to us. He will require, from our hands, the blood of sinners who go to hell because we refuse to tell them the truth that he who dies without receiving the forgiveness of sin which Jesus Christ offers will face eternal damnation.

				</p>
				
				<p>
					The emphasis today is on our personal responsibility as believers. Our God is a ‘personal’ God. When He called us unto salvation, we responded one by one. Even if we answered the call unto salvation in the same worship service or on the same crusade ground at the same hour, each of us has a separate record in heaven. There is a record for the works of faith which we do by grace. The greatest work we can do on earth is to labour for the salvation of the souls of sinners. The saints in earlier generations labored for our salvation through prayers. Many of them suffered all manners of perils. I once jokingly told some believers that as covenant children and children of the prophets (Acts 3:25), we may not truly know our ‘father’ who ‘birthed’ us unto salvation. The truth is that someone travailed as a groaning saint that we might be saved. The best way to show appreciation for those travailing saints is for us to engage in the same labour and preach the gospel to sinners so that our ‘own children’ might come from afar too to fulfill the prophecy of Isaiah.

				<p>
God has raised you, firstly, as a watchman for every person who is yet to be saved in your family. Secondly, He has also set you as a watchman for those in your neighbourhood who are yet to know Christ. Thirdly, He has raised you as a watchman for your friends. In the forth category, you are a watchman for the souls of sinners who are your colleagues, those in your trade or in your school. We cannot afford to wish the sinners what they wish themselves by abandoning them to their sin. You are one man or woman whom the Lord is counting upon to stand as a watchman. Will you fail Him? I guess you will not. . Rejoice in the Lord.				</p>
