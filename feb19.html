            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Psalm 20:1-4 </h3>
            <pre><code>M.V: Gen. 8:1<br>                         
And God remembered
Noah, and every living
thing, and all the cattle
that was with him in
the ark: and God made
a wind to pass over the
earth, and the
waters asswaged;</code></pre>God is committed to rewarding those who diligently seek Him. Those who truly seek God are His diligent servants. They seek daily to do His will and to pursue His purpose. They are not selfish like many of us. In our generation, many Christians crawl before God in prayers daily looking for what God will do for them. They are daily obsessed with how their needs will be met.<br>They never ask God about what they can do for the kingdom of God directly or indirectly by ministering to the needs of humanity. They don’t make personal sacrifices so that the corporate good can be further advanced. For such people, God may not have much to remember them for.<br><br>From our scripture reading for today, it is clear that God may tie certain blessings to your previous acts of sacrifice or benevolence. Noah was sold out to the service of God in an assignment that looked foolish and unrealistic to many people. There was no naturally perceivable reason to build an ark because there was no rain although God knew that a flood that was bigger than ordinary rain was coming. Noah gave up everything to pursue that assignment and for many days during the flood, he was caught away with the other survivors in the ark until the waters receded from the surface of the earth. Life in the ark was supposed to be for a while. Eventually, God remembered that His servant Noah needed a fresh lease of life and He brought them all out of the ark in safety so they would continue their lives. God remembered the man who had been in the service for Him .<br><br>Let us get personal now: What kind of offering have you brought before the Lord? What manner of service have you rendered that can provoke divine remembrance on your behalf? What have you sacrificed or given up for the benefit of someone else or for the interest of the kingdom? Your deeds, by the enablement of grace, are like your savings in the bank account. Your acts are stored up for a day when your need will require that you draw from your savings account. If the account is in credit, you will be obliged; otherwise there will be nothing for you. This calls for wisdom. What will God remember you for? Rejoice in the Lord.<br><br><div
