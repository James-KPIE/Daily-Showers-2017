And had a wall great and
high, and had twelve
gates, and at the gates
twelve angels, and names
written thereon, which
are the names of the
twelve tribes of the
children of Israel:</code></pre>

				The mind of Jesus is that all shall be saved. He came into the world not to condemn the world but that the world through Him might be saved (John 3:17). The gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ –the good news, the salvation message has been preached since the time of John the Baptist. Even before then Moses called the Israelites to choose life and live (Deuteronomy 30:19) instead of choosing death or cursing. The
purpose of the message of salvation is to prepare everyone for the second coming of the Messiah when everyone shall receive the just reward for whatever he or she has done in the flesh.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Our present actions on earth – our deeds are all adding up as a seed which we are sowing for a future harvest that will be revealed. Joshua warned the Israelites to make the right choice. He had the same future in mind. It shall be the harvest time when lairs, idolaters, whoremongers, the adulterers and the hypocrites shall face the music of the final judgment. Everyone who has become of a reprobate mind, doing abhorable acts and approving the things which the Lord expressly condemned in His word will have to face the judgment. Those who are turning the word of the Lord upside down and engaging in all kinds of perversion will discover their folly on that day but it will be too late. Christ’s mind that has been made expressly clear and certain to us through His word will never change. This is the time to repent and live for Jesus. <b>The greatest folly is to be an enemy of God.</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Christ, the coming King has spoken to us as the lamb. However, He will come as the Lion to judge all that we do here on earth. The events of the endtime have been unfolding for years now. Most of the things Jesus Christ said would happen – the wars, the earthquakes, nations rising against nations, family feuds and perversion in a scale that was not heard of before, the abasement of humanity, self-love, murders, persecutions and many more are rampant all over the world. It is time that everyone should take a deep breath and re-think. We should ask ourselves the vital question everyday – where will what I am doing now lead me? Will I be able to face the Lion of Judah with the present state of my mind-with all the malice, impure motives and hate. Let us take advantage of the time we all have-today and repent for tomorrow may be too late. Rejoice in the Lord.
