I will instruct thee and

thou shalt go: I will guide 
thee with mine eye.</code></pre>

				Divine intervention comes much more easily to those who engage constantly in true worship especially people of the altar. Abraham received divine guidance just as his son Isaac and grandson Jacob did. In the case of Jacob, divine direction came to him when he turned to God at Bethel and rededicated himself to God as a man of the altar. True worship brings down God’s
presence just as praise creates a habitat for God on the earth (Psalm 22:3). The content of our worship naturally makes that to occur. When we worship God, we are focused on the person of God alone. We are not inundated with our problems neither are we absorbed by our challenges. Worship puts God in the centre and magnifies Him. It is all about Him and it is His glory we want to see. In true worship our heart pants after God saying ‘I want to want God.’ When we are engrossed in such rapturous worship, divine presence becomes real and spiritual signals will usually come from which we can pick direction as we receive instruction.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The Bible asks us to draw near to God so He will draw near to us. The word of God also tells us that God is with us while we are with Him. (James 4:8 and 2 Chronicles 15:2). So God waits for us to initiate authentic worship. The reason is simple: God is always constant whereas we are the variable. We can go off and on, on our consecration. Circumstances can cause our faith to fluctuate. We may even feel some sense of frustration some times. We are vulnerable to certain upsetting situations because we are human, but God is not. The opportunity to worship is an opportunity for our humanity to submit to God’s divinity. It is a moment when the human can be influenced by the divine. Worship provides an opportunity for us to find rest in God and express our trust in Him once again.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				God is committed to teach the humble the way He shall choose. God is interested in guiding us so we do not end up as prey for the devil. He wants to teach us the way to profit from whatever we engage in. (Isaiah 48:17). We can experience all that as we come to the place of worship. Humility defines our posture before God as we worship. We come to Him as children who do not know much and as we open ourselves unto Him, just as we are in the place of worship, God in His mercy will show us the way and guide us in the way we shall go. Rejoice in the Lord.
