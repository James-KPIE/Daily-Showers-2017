                        <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Prov. 6:6-11 </h3>
                        <pre><code> <b style="color:red">M.V: Prov. 13:11</b> <br>                         
Wealth gotten by
vanity shall be
diminished: but he
that gathereth by
labour shall increase.</code></pre><div style="text-align: justify;">Indolence is a curse. It is the shortest route to poverty. It is one definition of insanity to want to earn wages for which one has not worked. If you find a person who does not like to work, run away from him. He is either a thief or a fraudster. Once again I must<br>emphasize that we are talking about the right work which means the work which God approves. If you are doing a dirty job which is unknown to people and you stay unrepentant in a church, paying your tithe and making other financial contributions you are heaping curse on yourself from God because He cannot be mocked. No sacrifice will appease God for the iniquity of man except the blood of His Son that was shed for our redemption. It is better to go hungry than to engage in any job that is unholy before God. The sacrifice of the sinner is abomination to God (Proverbs 15:8).<br><br>The emphasis today is on what we actually do in the course of our work. I teach <blockquote>“Church Organization and Administration”</blockquote> in a Bible College and in one of the subjects we consider time savers and time wasters. Basically; we look at those things that may take your time and make you less productive at work particularly for a person who probably deals with files and documents in the office. Excessive time on phone calls, receiving visitors during work hours, sleeping at work, giving too much attention to the television in the banking hall and some other issues constitute time wasting. As a young boy I was fascinated with a song rendered by a local musician in those days. Incidentally, it was composed in English language and it goes thus <blockquote>“Work while you work; play while you play; to be useful and happy, this is the way.”</blockquote></div><div

style="text-align: justify;">Each of us must consider our input vis-à-vis the remuneration we are paid at work. If you like to earn money for the hours during which you did nothing, it is immoral and ungodly. There is another reward that is even more important than the reward of the money that you earn from work. It is called goodwill. It builds up for you as you work with the right attitude. Ill-gotten money may fetch trouble rather than good for a person who did not actually earn it in the first place. Be warned. Rejoice in the Lord</div><br><div
