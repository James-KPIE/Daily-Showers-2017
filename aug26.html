            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: John 15:8</strong> <br>                         
Herein is my Father
glorified, that ye bear
much fruit; so shall
ye be my disciples</code></pre>

				Another benefit of getting involved in the Great Commission apart from the joy of seeing a sinner saved, is the fulfillment of the mandate of our Master. In the first place, when we consider who we used to be, how rotten some of us were morally and how far deep in sin we had gone, little wonder
how God would even turn to show us mercy and forgive our sins, let alone raising us as part of the kingdom labour force for evangelism and soul-winning. However, it has pleased God in His mercy to use us without any merit, to do great works in His kingdom. When Paul the apostle recounted his religious background and the kind of errands he had run to stop the propagation of the gospel, he concluded that it was pure grace that had gotten him to the enviable position of being counted worthy to be a servant of the Most High.
<br /><br />
To fulfill the Master’s mandate requires that we make the kingdom assignment our number one priority. It means to lay our hands on the plough as the Master said in Luke 9:62. It requires that we lay our time, treasure and talent all at the Master’s feet that He may use them in the manner He chooses.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The Master has chosen us and raised us as co-workers in His vineyard. He has empowered us to go into the sinful world and draw out men and women from darkness into his marvelous light. We have seen how it pleased Him to use people like Peter, Paul and Stephen and Philip and many more to prosecute the agenda of His kingdom. We have seen the great results that followed the obedience to the call and we have seen the joy that the saints on earth can provoke in heaven for leading a sinner into the righteousness of Christ. We are, therefore, privileged to be in a position to fulfill the Master’s mandate on the earth.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				God can achieve His eternal purpose without us but He has chosen to get us involved in the project. It is a further testimony that we have indeed been conveyed from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of his dear Son. Thank God we are not running errands for the devil. Thank God we are involved in saving souls from the captivity of sin. Thank God we are a part of the Great commission raised on the earth for the redemption of sinners. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
