            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: 2 Thess. 3:7-12 </h3>
            <pre><code> M.V: Pro. 14:23<b style="color:red"></b> <br>                         
In all labour there is
profit: but the talk of
the lips tendeth only
to penury.</code></pre>The kingdom covenant reward system as it relates to our work shall be our focus for the next few days. In my book titled FINANCIAL FREEDOM (2009), the subject of work from the Bible perspective covers sixty pages. God is interested in how we work and we must understand how He sees our work because He is the ultimate rewarder. Any man who does not like to work and put all his might into whatever God-glorifying work his hands find to do, cannot be considered a true child of God. Our Father in heaven is a worker. He hates folks who want to eat without working or those who want something for nothing. In God’s kingdom, those who desire to prosper must embrace the spirit of diligence.<br><br>God has promised to make whatever we do to prosper, according to Psalm 1:3. Therefore our work provides the opportunity for God to shower His blessings upon our lives. God does not just pour down His blessings. If a man’s hands are empty, then God is not at fault if that man suffers hunger. Many people conclude that they can find no work to do. The truth is that there are jobs which many people may not want to do. It must be admitted, however, that the greed and selfishness that rule the lives of the few affluent individuals in the underdeveloped countries have made matters worse for many of the under-privileged. There is so much inequality in the distribution of the wealth of those nations. It was contended sometime ago that less than 10% of Nigerians were sitting on more than 90% of the wealth of the nation, thus impoverishing a large percentage of the people.<br><br>It is unfortunate that the door of opportunity which is shut against many people often result from the negative attitude of some of the privileged few. Those who are corrupt make in-roads into people-centred policies thereby limiting people’s opportunities. In the first place. These corrupt people are not working as unto the Lord. The Bible asks us to work as unto the Lord. In other words, our foremost consideration in all the work should be whether or not the Lord is pleased with us. And it is our motive that will determine the ultimate reward. Rejoice in the Lord.<br><br><div
