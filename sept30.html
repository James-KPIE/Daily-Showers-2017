            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Isaiah 5:11-13 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Hos. 4:6</strong> <br>                         
My people are destroyed for 
lack of knowledge: because 
thou hast rejected knowledge, 
I will also reject thee, that 
thou shalt be no priest to me: 
seeing thou hast forgotten the 
law of thy God, I will also 
forget thy children.</code></pre>

				Ignorance is a deadly disease. A person who is spiritually ignorant is blind to the truth and cannot live by the truth. Since we triumph by the truth, the ignorant fellow will remain an underdog because he lacks the know–how to get ahead of those things that keep him at the same spot in life. Consider our father Abraham. He was called, alone by God (Isaiah 51:2) but he ignorantly took Lot his nephew along with him. As long as Lot was with him, God was, first, watching him and the divine instruction for the advancement of his journey was not forthcoming. As soon as he got separated from Lot, God resumed
His partnership with him. Ignorance has the capacity to cause a man to experience stagnation. That is why God is always ready to guide us and show us the way to go so we do not perish in ignorance (Psalm 32:8, Isaiah 30:21 and Job 22:22).
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Israel stumbled many times because they walked in ignorance. It has been said that a man who lacks information suffers deformation. It is ignorance that keeps many people living in sin because their minds are not enlightened to see the losses of the sinner and the blessings of the repentant. When Saul of Tarsus was ignorant as a religious Pharisee, he persecuted people of the Way. When his eyes were opened, he surrendered his whole life to prosecute the agenda of the kingdom.
				</p>
				
				<p>
There are Christians who are yet to understand their heritage in redemption. So, they suffer under some kinds of oppression. For example, some Christians only ask for healing from time to time whereas they can ask for wholeness or total health and live a sickness–free life. God’s promise is to take sickness away from the midst of your family (Exodus 15:26, 23:25 and Deuteronomy 7:14-15). Therefore, you can activate your faith for that reality and it will be yours. Every believer also belongs to the kingdom of God where Jesus Christ reigns and exercises the King’s dominion. And that kingdom has an economy from where we can receive blessings as we sow our seeds. The believer is not earthly–limited. He is connected to heaven–the kingdom where there is no scarcity. Seek to know the kingdom more and more and you will break the power of delay through knowledge. Rejoice in the Lord.
