							<h1>YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO GIVE</h1>

							<!-- Text -->
								<section>
									<h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>							<h4 align="right">Fri. Feb. 3, 2017</h4>
									
									<h3 style=color:red>Daily Reading: 1 Chro. 28:1-6 </h3>
									<pre><code> <b style=color:redM.V: Prov. 11:25</b> <br />                         
The liberal soul shall be
made fat: and he that
watereth shall be
watered also himself.</code></pre> 

									<p>
For the constraint of space the topic for today actually is ‘You always have something to give.’ And that is true. Giving begins from your soul or your heart. Indeed God will only honour a
gift that proceeds from the heart. See Exodus 35:5; 35:21; 35:29; 1 Chro. 29:9, 17;
2Cor. 9:7. Giving begins with a disposition to give. That is why God commended David for having it in his heart to give towards the building of the temple. There are people who may not be able to give financially at some occasion. We should not be hard on them especially when we have not heard, from them, why they are unable to. Those who cannot give can still receive the blessing if they can pray from their hearts towards the accomplishment of a particular corporate project. Their sincere prayers may even cause God to release more resources beyond the calculations of the church.
									</p>
									<p>
I have found it to be true that when it is in our hearts to give, it will soon be in our hands to release. You don’t begin to give when you have excess. No, and that is the secret to financial breakthrough. God asked my family to give our only landed property with a building under construction and we did. When ‘sacrifices’ were called for, at a time when the church was raising money for projects my family ‘sowed’ our television sets on two occasions. The refrigerator in our house had gone that way before. Within fourteen years, we had sowed six cars including two S.U.Vs to the kingdom mission projects and to missionaries on the field. The rug carpet in our house had been washed and sowed as well, to give an office a new look in the church. Electronic items which gifts that my family received were sowed, as well to the church to serve any purpose that they could. <b>When it is in your heart to give, you will always have something to give.</b>									</p>
									<p>
You can trust God that He will not owe anybody and He always remembers. The motive behind our sacrifice was to make provisions for the requirements of the house of God. I use the word requirement because the house of God should not be described as needy. We should not describe the church of God as being in need because the God of the church is not needy. Receive the heart of a giver and your hand will never be empty. Rejoice in the Lord.									</p>
