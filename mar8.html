I waited patiently for the

me, and heard my cry.</code></pre>

				Abraham’s credential number fourteen was his patience. Of all virtues, patience is golden. God taught Abraham to be patient and he was. It was only when Sarah (the wife whom Abraham respected) suggested that Hagar be put in the family way that Abraham’s patience was punctuated. Thereafter, he continued to be patient with God.<br /><br />
We can never understand all the reasons why God would have us wait for the fulfillment of our desires even when they are not contrary to His will. In Abraham’s case it was God who opened up the issue of descendants and inheritance for Abraham. Right at the beginning of their very first discourse, according to Genesis 12:3, God told Abraham that in Him the families of the earth shall be blessed. In Genesis 12:7, God appeared unto Abraham again and said: “Unto thy seed will I give this land…” In Genesis 13:15, God told Abraham again: “For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed forever.” Then in verse 16, the Lord continued: “And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth; so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.” Abraham received the promises without saying a word until Genesis 15:3 where he told God: “Behold, to me Thou hast given no seed: and lo, one born in my house is mine heir.” God promptly dismissed that conclusion of Abraham in verse 4 and told him that his seed shall come from his own body.<br /><br />
After the assurances that God gave to Abraham, the man of faith still had to wait. We can never understand why we need to wait atimes when it is in God’s power to do in the instant whatever He says. In Ecclesiastes 3:11, the scripture says: “He hath made everything beautiful in His time…” That is why people say that God’s time is the best. We never know whether our own desired time will coincide with any evil! So much is kept away from us that only the Omniscient God knows. It pays to wait for Him. Job said in Job 14:14: “all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change comes.” That is what Abraham eventually did. Let us follow Abraham’s steps. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
