            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: John 15:12-16 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Jn. 15:16</strong> <br>                         
Ye have not chosen me, but I 
have chosen you, and ordained 
you, that ye should go and 
bring forth fruit, and that 
your fruit should remain: that 
whatsoever ye shall ask of the 
Father in my name, he may give 
it you.</code></pre>

				<p>
				In Isaiah 45:19, the Lord Almighty declared that He did not call the seed of Jacob to seek Him in vain. In other words, we do not serve God for nothing. He promises to bless us if we obey and serve Him (Job 36:11). He says we shall eat the good of the land if we are obedient. (Isaiah 1:19). In God’s kingdom, obedience is the secret of abundance. Obedience is the key to advancement and enlargement. When we obey God, we open the door of our lives unto Him and very soon we shall enjoy His wonders.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				One of the key areas where we must obey the commandment of our Lord Jesus Christ is in soul–winning. In our memory verse for today our Lord Jesus Christ gives us a guarantee of answered prayers if we will preach to souls and watch them give their lives to Him by the convicting power of the Holy Spirit and follow such people up until they are established in Christ as saved and sanctified souls. That is what our Lord Jesus referred to when He said <blockquote>“and that your fruit should abide.”</blockquote> He said that if we will do that, then our prayers shall be answered. That is the antidote for delay in obtaining answers to prayers and consequently obtaining speed to our journey in life. Therefore, it is not enough to fast and pray. Many believers don’t evangelize at all. Yet they complain that their prayers are not answered. <b>In God’s kingdom, nothing goes for nothing.</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Some years ago I embarked on a little research on what I must do so I will not be stranded in life. I wanted to find out if there are holy, spiritual ‘short–cuts’ to a life of abundance and steady success and I found at least three. The three strategies have made my labour on the altar of prayers to be lesser, yet with results. The first is this John 15:16. When you follow it through, you are placed at the level of automatic (Isaiah 65:24). The second is the principle in 1 Peter 3:7. Simply put, when you make life easy for your wife, heaven does so for you. If it is otherwise–may be you are a wife–beater, or you starve your wife of money and other necessities of life, sooner or later you will suffer from stagnation. Loss of good jobs and other incidents of hardship may follow if you violate that scripture. The third is Ecclesiastics 11:1-3 which is called <b>cloud loading</b>, according to my mentor. He said that <b>as long as there is a seed in your hand (to sow) you have a tomorrow.</b> You can run your life by these scriptures and avoid delay and hardship. Rejoice in the Lord.
