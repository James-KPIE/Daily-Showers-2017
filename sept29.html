            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Joshua 7:10-20 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Jos. 7:11</strong> <br>                         
Israel hath sinned, and they 
have also transgressed my 
covenant which I commanded 
them: for they have even 
taken of the accursed thing, 
and have also stolen, and 
dissembled also, and they 
have put it even among their 
own stuff.</code></pre>

				<p>
				The Lord of hosts was the Conqueror in all the battles which Israel won. Israel was victorious in those battles because the Lord was with them. It was not because the Israelites were superior militarily or greater in number. Most times, their enemies had the advantage of numerical strength. Nevertheless, Jehovah Nissi always gave them victory. Each time Israel lost a battle such as when the Philistines defeated them and carried the ark of the covenant away, their defeat was traceable to sin. According to Isaiah 59:1-2, sin always brings a separation between us and God. The sinner is a loser. He loses divine presence, he loses divine peace, he loses divine partnership, he loses
divine prospect, he loses divine prosperity, he loses divine power and he loses divine placement in heaven, unless he repents.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				There were two sins which brought defeat upon Israel from the smaller Ai city. The first was the sin of Achan who had stolen some stuff. He brought reproach upon Israel and made God to distance Himself from them since God will not behold iniquity (Habakkuk 1:13). The second sin was the sin of presumption. Without consulting with God to take direction from Him, Israel assumed superior strength over the small Ai city and concluded that a few soldiers would easily rattle Ai. They were shocked as Ai routed them and the defeat plunged the entire nation into sorrow and mourning. Joshua the veteran army general was downcast. It was then that the Lord came in and told Israel the reason behind the defeat–there was sin in the camp of Israel.
				</p>
				
				<p>
Sin has brought serious setback to many people in the course of their journey on this side of eternity. Unfortunately, many people seem to engage in the game of self–deception by carrying on in sin and suffering delay thereby, without confessing and forsaking their sin. God is a great and merciful benefactor. He shows mercy to those who will confess their sins and return to Him and trust in Him for turnaround and victory. The delay in conquering Ai in the campaign to possess the promised land ended when Israel took” the accursed thing” out of the camp and Achan paid the supreme price for his sin. If you forsake sin, God will add speed to your journey. Rejoice in the Lord.
