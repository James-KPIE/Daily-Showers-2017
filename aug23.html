            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: John 1:12</strong> <br>                         
But as many as received 
him, to them gave he 
power to become the
sons of God, even tothem that 
believe on his name:</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>It is God’s delight to give power to children of the kingdom who are committed to the expansion of the kingdom. Our focus today is to address the misconception of many brethren who are asking for power whereas God has already given it to them. Sometimes when we ask for power, God’s response to us may be to ask for what we have done with the power He has already released to us.
				<br /><br />
				The power of God follows us whenever we accept the commitment to seek souls for the kingdom of God. The power is released upon us when we are baptized by the Holy Spirit but it is activated when we go into action on behalf of the Master who gave us the mandate. God will never send a man on an errand without giving him a measure of power which is commensurate to the weight of the assignment. The reason for this is simple. In 1 Samuel 2: 9, His word says we cannot prevail (over the power of the adversary that wishes to keep the souls of men in bondage eternally) by our own strength. Moreover, Jesus Christ Himself also told us that without Him we can do nothing. Therefore power is automatically released to us when we embark on the most important task in the kingdom which is soul-winning.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Every son and daughter of the kingdom is a carrier of power. We need this power because the kingdom is constantly at war. The adversary goes about like a roaring lion, looking for who he will devour. We need the power of the Holy Spirit to resist every pressure of temptation and to turn to flight every appearance of the evil one through any device whatsoever. We need the power of the Holy Spirit to be sensitive to the plans of the wicked to supernaturally diminish the fear of God in our hearts as it has happened in many sophisticated societies. The adversary has caused the erosion of Biblical values through subtle means over the centuries. Families had been careless to abandon their family altars, fellowship of students and the reading of the Bible as well as prayers have been outlawed in schools. So everybody does what he likes. Meanwhile, the devil took advantage of such lapses to be grooming and empowering the demonic troublers of the world who are causing havoc at monumental proportions all over the world today.
				
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The remnant in Zion must arise in the power of the Holy Spirit and pray earnestly that revival would take place all around the world again so that the souls of men and women will be rescued from hell. That is the reason why Jesus gave us power. You have that power already. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
