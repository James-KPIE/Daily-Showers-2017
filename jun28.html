            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: 1 Sam. 28:1-7 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Isa. 59:1-2</strong> <br>                         
Behold, the LORD'S
hand is not
shortened, that it
cannot save; neither
his ear heavy, that it
cannot hear: But your
iniquities have
separated between
you and your God,
and your sins have
hid his face from you,
that he will not hear.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				We shall consider, in the next few days, reasons why we may experience God’s silence during in our journey with Him. The first obvious reason is sin because sin brings a separation between man and God. The line of communication was cut off when Adam and Eve sinned in the Garden. In fact, Adam and his wife hid themselves from God because of the shame of their sin. Sin breaks our fellowship with God but blessed be God who can show us mercy again if we will humble ourselves before Him, admit our errors and amend our ways. Habakkuk 1:13 says God is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				King Saul was the first King of Israel. He had everything going for him until he began to disobey specific instructions given by the servant and prophet of God. For example, when he was told to wipe out the Amalekites, he spared some rams which he said he preserved as an offering to the God of Samuel. He also usurped the priest’s ordained function of bringing the offering before the Lord although he argued later that he did so because he listened to the voice of the people. As a result of Saul’s refusal to honour God in obedience, the Lord turned away from him and he was left alone. Bible scholars tell us that Saul was left on the throne for forty years, without partnership with God.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				It was traditional for the leader of Israel to seek God’s face and His word before proceeding to battle against their enemies in those days. We can recall that when Joshua acted presumptuously, the nation of Israel paid dearly for it as they lost the first battle against Ai, a very small city. Israel was preparing to fight one of their unrelenting enemies, the Philistines and now Saul went to ask God about it but not a word came from God. So, he resorted to seeking revelation through familiar spirit. The witch at Endor became his consultant. That consultation was an abomination under the laws which God gave to Israel according to Deuteronomy 18:10-11. It was the beginning of the end for King Saul, as he perished in the battle with his sons and the nation of Israel lost the battle to the Philistines. That is the danger of proceeding into battle without God.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The wise thing to do is never to turn away to seek an alternative to God but wait with a heart of repentance when God is silent. Rejoice in the Lord.
