            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Mark 2:1-11 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Mark 2:10</strong> <br>                         
But that ye may
know that the Son
of man hath power
on earth to forgive
sins, (he saith to
the sick of the
palsy,)</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				From today we shall trust in the Holy Spirit to unveil how Jesus heals so we can access total health through understanding. Jesus heals by His deity. He is the mighty God, the everlasting Father and the Prince of Peace (Isaiah 9:6). He shares the same nature with God the Father and God the Holy Spirit. They are co-existent, co-powerful, co-eternal and they
work together as One. In essence they are really inseparable. For example power resides in God the Father (Psalm 62:11) and in the Son (Matthew 28:18) and in the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:8). The deity of Jesus means He is the supreme King who rules in His kingdom and of the increase of His government there shall be no end (Isaiah 9:6). So, Jesus Christ our Lord has absolute power over everything which God has created, over everything that exists, over every other power in heaven, on the earth and underneath the earth. He walked on the sea because He has power over the waters. The earth vomited Him on the third day after His death because the earth is under His power. He rode through the sky to the heavens because He controls the air. Everything is subject to His power and His power is subject to nothing. No one can hinder Him from achieving anything He has purposed to do. He is unstoppable (Isaiah 43:13).
				</p>
				
				<p>
				It is important to believe in this power that can accomplish anything and tap into it for our maximum advantage in redemption. When you gain the understanding that your redemptive status has ushered you into the realm of supernatural advantage, your faith receives a boost automatically and you stand on the platform of kingdom authority in the realm of the spirit to do as occasion demands. Therefore you are confronting the problem that faces you from a vantage position in Christ and you are not addressing that issue e.g sickness from outside of Christ. Your word at that position becomes a law in the realm of the spirit because you speak by the authority of Jesus Christ with a tongue and authority that the enemy cannot resist (Luke 21:15).
				</p>
				
				<p>
				When we operate in the light, we easily prevail over darkness. Sickness is an agent of darkness and an agent of death. Many people have died through one kind of sickness or the other. Medical science even tells us that certain sicknesses are incurable but not with Jesus Christ. When our standing in Jesus Christ is sure, we are simply empowered to overcome by faith whatever cannot resist or contend with the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ. He has power on earth to forgive sins and to heal all sicknesses. Rejoice in the Lord.
