Now the sons of Eli were 
sons of Belial; they 
knew not the LORD.</code></pre>

				Some parents idolize their children in an effort to pamper and make them to have the best in life. This is common to three groups of parents. The first group is those parents who wait for many years after marriage before they have children. Naturally,
they treasure such children and would do whatever is in their power to make them comfortable. The second group of parents are those parents who had very tough beginnings, who rose from the ashes of poverty and struggled very hard to make it in life. Such parents may even swear not to allow their children to suffer. The third group of parents are the careless parents like Eli who would not discipline their children or set the feet of such children in the way of the Lord. Any form of idolizing a child can be counter–productive to the life and destiny of the child.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				I heard about some parents who would not allow their children to write notes in their classrooms. They would rather provide money for such children to make photocopies of the notes of their classmates. There are parents who would not allow their teenagers to do any washing, even of their own little clothings. Such children would not go as far as engage in house cleaning or learning to prepare food. Such indulgencies may be dangerous for the future of those children. Life is not all a bed of roses. Children who are kept away from the realities of life while they are young may not be able to stand on their own when they grow to the age of responsibility and accountability.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				A man of God once suggested that Isaac was already being idolized by Abraham and that was the reason why God demanded for Isaac to be offered as a sacrifice. What is clear to us from the Bible account is that God tested Abraham by making that demand so that Abraham could access God’s sworn blessings and the multiplication of his seed. However, in the case of Eli, it was clear that the old priest was careless and he allowed his idolized children to grow wild and uncontrolled in committing iniquities. As a result, the children brought sorrow to the family and disgrace, shame and sorrow to the entire nation of Israel. The Ark of Covenant was powerless in the hands of the sinful children as Israel lost a vital battle to the Philistines who also captured the Ark. Don’t idolize your children. It will not help their future. Rejoice in the Lord.
