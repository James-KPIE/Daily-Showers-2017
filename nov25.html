            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: John 8:1-11 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Gal. 3:28</strong> <br>                         
There is neither Jew nor
Greek, there is neither
bond nor free, there is
neither male nor female:
for ye are all one in
Christ Jesus.</code></pre>

				<p>
				Christ‘s mind does not discriminate against women. This issue formed a part of the counter-cultural teachings which our Lord Jesus taught us either as a teaching or in practice. The passage before us today does not only teach on sin. Jesus Christ told the woman who was dragged before Him and accused of adultery to go and sin no more. He
forgave her sin. Our Lord Jesus does not justify sin for any reason. The
other lesson which we learn from the passage is that Jesus Christ would not tolerate discrimination against women just as He would not approve any discrimination against children as we observed three days ago. Indeed our Lord Jesus hates all kinds of discrimination in any community.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				It was the culture of the Roman Empire to literally worship their lords and the men they considered great. In the case under consideration where was the man with whom the women committed adultery or was she alone in the acts? It was the age of male dominance in almost every spectrum of life. Today, this is the practice in many communities and in many religions. In one religion, their principal book describes women as people with no brains and accords them no respect or dignity. Their women, according to that book, are created to serve men. There are cultures where women are regularly maltreated too. I have heard women from such cultures refer to their husbands as their bosses. The implication of that can be serious at home. It means that the woman has no say in the affairs of her home and she must give consent to whatever demand the ‘boss’ makes on her. The woman’s sexual fulfillment is entirely at the mercy of her ‘boss’. Most wives in those cultures are glorified ‘slaves’ in their so-called matrimonial homes. The mind of Christ does not approve of this for where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The mind of Christ is expressed all over the pages of the scriptures. He spoke in diverse ways through the men whom He inspired to write the Bible. While Jesus would not have a woman disrespect her husband, Jesus Christ does not see the wife as a mere servant to the husband. Wise women honour and respect their husbands because they know that the husband is the head of the wife. Let me end this exhortation on this note again: husband’s love should be unconditional for his wife just as wife’s submission should be without any reservation. This will create room for the conducive atmosphere for a peaceful and flourishing home. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
