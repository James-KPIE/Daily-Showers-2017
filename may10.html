            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Ex. 20:4</strong> <br>                         

Thou shalt not make unto 
thee any graven image, or 
any likeness of any thing 
that is in heaven above, 
or that is in the earth 
beneath, or that is in 
the water under the earth:</code></pre>

				Idol worshippers are all over the globe. There are worshippers of graven images and even worshippers of animals such as snakes. In many places, it is an abomination to kill or eat such animals which the people worship as their gods. In other places, people worship the hills or mountains and ascribe such names as ‘saviour’ to such mountains. Other people worship rivers and other unimaginable objects. The children of Israel were like these idolaters and they stayed with their idols to the anger of
the God of Israel. Unfortunately, several kings of Israel were drawn into idolatry. It was King Josiah who became intolerant of those idols and destroyed them during his reign. There are worshippers of those idols even till today.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				There is an instinct in man that makes his soul desire to look up to a higher power or deity. And that deity is the Almighty God, the Creator of man and the Sustainer of all the living. We are made by Him and we exist by His mercy. In Job 33:4, Job declared: “The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.” You must have wondered at people who worship graven images carved by their own hands, how foolish such people are. The natural tendency of man to want to give attention to what he can see or observe, physically, may be responsible for the creation of those idols by man. However, the Bible calls those who seek other gods and who worship graven images foolish. Indeed, it is foolish to worship something that is not only lifeless but was created by the hands of man. You will recall that in Exodus 32, the children of Israel took to idolatry before Moses returned from mount Sinai. In His anger God commanded the idolaters to be killed (verse 27) and thousands perished because of idolatry.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Our God is a jealous God. He deserves our worship and no one besides Him does. He created us to worship Him and bring praise to His name by the way we live (Isaiah 43:21). All things are created for His pleasure (Revelation 4:11). He is the living God who gives life to everything He has made. Those who are wise will worship God for there is no one else like Him. Idolatry is sin because it exalts other things but God. Rejoice in the Lord.
