Flee also youthful lusts: 
but follow righteousness, 
faith, charity, peace, with 
them that call on the Lord 
out of a pure heart.</code></pre>

				<p>
				Sex can be an idol and indeed many people have idolized sex. Sex has been described as the ultimate pleasure of the flesh but God did not create it to become what a man or a woman lives for. God created man with the sex instinct and it is given to be enjoyed within marriage. Sex outside marriage is called fornication and when a married person ventures into sex outside marriage, it is called adultery.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The pleasure of the flesh can put a man or woman in captivity, if it is not controlled. The adversary appeals to the flesh in order to cause man to sin against God. That was the case in the garden of Eden. The serpent showed the forbidden fruit to Eve and got her to agree that it was good and attractive in appearance and desirable for making one wise. She took some of it and ate and later gave some to her husband who also ate it. Addiction to sex occurs when the mind cannot look away from what is seemingly good and appealing to the flesh; it will yield to the temptation to commit sin in the flesh. The battle ground for sin is the mind. The devil has no power to make any person to commit sin. So, when a man falls into the sin of adultery or fornication and blames the devil; that is an untenable alibi. The sin is committed because the mind lost control at a point. Proverbs 25:28 says that a man without self–control is like a city whose walls are broken down. The way out of any kind of addiction is to strength the mind by renewing same with the word of God. That is why Romans 12:2 warns us not to be conformed to this world but to be continuously transformed by the renewing of our minds, so that we may be able to determine what God’s will is–what is proper, pleasing, and perfect. The escape route from the sin of the flesh is to feed fat on the word of God and flee at the appearance of evil.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Sex must be seen as a God–given pleasure which must not be abused and we need the fear of God. It was the fear of God that kept Joseph from falling into the sin of fornication, even when it was presented so cheaply by the wife of his master. Proverbs 16:6(b) tells us that it is by the fear of God that a man departs from iniquity. If you begin to live by the fear of God, sex will not become an idol to you and your soul shall not be ensnared by it. Rejoice in the Lord.
