            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: John 9:4</strong> <br>                         

I must work the works of 
him that sent me, while 
it is day: the night 
cometh, when no man can 
work.</code></pre>

				<p>
				Today is International Workers’ Day and issues that are connected to labour and workers generally will be the focus of both the governments and labour unions around the world.
				<br /><br />
				Work is very important because it is the guarantee of wealth. To desire to be rich or comfortable without a serious plan as to what to do in terms of mental and physical input, is to day–dream. It amounts to mere wishful thinking. About three decades ago, the Pentecostal world was awash with the principle of confession and possession. In other words, many Christians were taught to believe that whatever they confess they will possess. I heard with my ears when a young man who was in the high school was confessing the possession of a multi–million naira exotic car. He had no plans to work; indeed he was yet to be qualified to work. As good as the principle sounds, only those whose hands and mentality are engaged in labour are entitled to confess and possess (Proverbs 14:23). It is immoral to seek to prosper without doing anything. That is contrary to the word of God in Psalm 1:3 and Ecclesiastics 9:10.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<b>High life is a reward for hard work.</b> Our covenant–keeping God is a worker. He worked from the beginning of creation and He still works. This is contrary to what theologians would have us believe. They say that God worked for six days and stopped working on the seventh. No! The Lord God only had a break on the Sabbath to rest and kept on working, thereafter. That is why God neither slumbers nor sleeps. He works day and night and our Lord Jesus confirmed this when He said: “my Father works hitherto and I work.” (John 5:17). God sets the pace for us to work and to act otherwise is ungodly and vain–mindedness.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The choice to work is one of the greatest choices each of us needs to make for a robust destiny. Work does not kill, it is laziness that kills. God will only support the hard–working. His help is easily accessible to those who will do as He does. Jesus Christ came to the earth to work. All our covenant fathers worked. We are told to look unto Abraham our father (Isaiah 51:2). We should imitate his commitment to hard work. Rejoice in the Lord.
