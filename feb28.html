            <h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>
            <h4 align="right">Tue. Feb.28, 2017</h4>
            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Gen. 32:9-24 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Gen. 32:24</strong> <br>                         
And Jacob was left
alone; and there
wrestled a man with
him until the
breaking of the day.</code></pre>The seventh covenant credential of Abraham was the power of singleness. According to Isaiah 51:2, God called him alone and blessed him and made him great. The crowd can be a hindrance to growth, spiritual growth that is. That is why some people prefer a small congregation so they would not be lost in the crowd. Whether you are in a large or small church, your spiritual growth will ultimately depend on the depth of your singleness before God, that is the basis for our conclusion yesterday. What you obtain in the hallowed presence of God in your time of being alone with Him is what determines what you can contribute to the corporate goals either in your family or in your church or even in your business place.<br><br>Believers are raised in the cubicles of singleness and their strength of character emanates from there. For example if you find it difficult to forgive those who offend you, it is not probably because you have not read about forgiveness or heard it preached. It is because in your singleness before the Lord, you have not developed the spirit of forgiveness. <b>Until you settle an issue with God it cannot become a part of your character.</b> That is why the fear of God is a difficult thing to demonstrate for many of us Christians. <b>The depth of our devotion will determine the ‘tallness’ of our character.</b> If we have not been affected by a thing, we cannot create an effect from it. It is difficult to generate an impact when you have not been impacted. Pure Christianity is baked in the oven of secrecy or privacy with God. That is why serious people crave for more and more time alone with their Maker. Singleness is standing before God alone. It does not mean loneliness.<br><br>The story of Jacob shows us what he learnt from his father Isaac and his grandfather Abraham. When he partnered with his mother instead of God, the consequences almost cost him his life but when he learnt to sort things out with God his destiny began to experience a turnaround. <b>Don’t seek to be popular with people, just seek to be powerful with God. Desire His anointing above human appointment and instead of fame go for His flame. </b>Then you shall be unstoppable. Rejoice in the Lord.<br><br><div
