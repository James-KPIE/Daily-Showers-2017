Say unto them, As truly 
as I live, saith the

I do to you:</code></pre>

				<p>
				There is power in the Bible–based positive confession of a child of God. Every pronouncement from a sanctified tongue of a covenant child is forceful. That is why the Bible warns us not to be careless with our speech. Ecclesiastes 5:6 says we should not let our mouth lead us to sin. Angels are positioned around the children of God according to Psalm 34:7. Their
mission is primarily to guard and protect us but beyond that, they also have an assignment to minister to us. Now, what we are saying can either keep the angels with us or cause them to distance themselves from us. They are holy angels who listen to our conversations. If we speak God–glorifying words and we speak from the abundance of the Word of God, those angels will take those words and use them to minister to us. On the other hand, those who speak evil and bitter words all the time will have the attention of the devil to torment them. May you not keep the presence of God away from you by the words that you speak. Amen.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Positive confession is very good but it must be based on the word of God. What we do in positive confession is take the word of God and make it our own word in respect of the circumstances around us. Therefore, our positive confession will be a spiritual echo of the word which God has spoken. Since angels are on a mission to enforce God’s word on the earth, we indirectly put those angels at work over our lives. When you soak your destiny in prophecy at the dawn of the day, you have sent angels on errand ahead of you on that day. That is why you must start the day at the altar where you have fellowship with God and release the word of power into your day.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Positive confession must also be based on our conviction. Until we have a strong conviction in the word of God, our confession will not be powerful. The energy behind the words we confess is drawn from the conviction in our heart. This is so important. We have recently considered the exploits of David. When he declared those words in Psalm 23:1, he was deeply convinced in the truth of what he said such that his mind entertained no doubt about it. The way to a life of powerful, positive and productive confessions is to be a word–addict. When your heart is full of the word of God, you will live at all times and life will continue to deliver to you what you are confessing. Rejoice in the Lord.
