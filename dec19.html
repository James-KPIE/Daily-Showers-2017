For this cause we also,
since the day we heard
it, do not cease to pray
for you, and to desire
that ye might be filled
with the knowledge of

				<p>
				We are always encouraged in our faith journey when we realize that we are not alone in our struggles, in our temptations and in our persecution. The bond of fellowship with other believers in the vineyard of God provides comfort and some soothing when we experience the harshness of persecution and go through trials of faith. Jesus Christ left only one church birthed by one blood and nurtured by one spirit and as members of the church we are baptized by one baptism. Every person
who is redeemed by the precious blood of the Lamb is a member of the church of Christ.
<br /><br />
The focus of today’s devotion is to encourage us as to stay in the kingdom as one body so we can be strong enough to influence our world for Jesus through the synergy of faith. In Philippians 4:3 and in 1 Thessalonians 3:2, apostle Paul referred to us as fellow workers He also refereed to Timothy as <blockquote><b>“our brother who works with us”</b></blockquote> in the second passage. Wherever believers are around the world, we are working together. There is no basis for discrimination amongst us along denominational lines. No one will enter into heaven by reason of belonging to a particular denomination but by reason of being washed by the blood of the Lamb.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We have also been called fellow-helpers according to 3 John 8. We are helpers to those who we need to nurture in discipleship unto growth in the body of Christ as well as helpers unto one another. We are our brother’s keepers. Part of the beauty of belonging to this same family of Jesus is that the interest of my brother has become my interest and vice-versa. In Colossians 1:7 and 4:7 Paul also called us fellow-servants. Even in the local church where we serve, we must de-emphasis ranking and emphasis bonding. The gap between the clergy and laity must not be too wide. The priest must be accessible to the flock. It is the ministry of reconciliation into which every believer has been commissioned that qualifies each of us as a servant of our Lord Jesus Christ. We are empowered by the same Holy Spirit for the work of ministry and our renewal is through the same word of life.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Let us round up today with this call to continue to pray for one another. Mature believers in any part of the world are touched when our brothers and sisters are beheaded in the Middle East or in any part of Africa. Let us daily intercede for all members of the household of faith especially that God will strengthen our faith to endure in this end time. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
