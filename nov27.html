            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: John 16:25-33 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: 1 John 5:4</strong> <br>                         
For whatsoever is born of
God overcometh the
world: and this is the
victory that overcometh
the world, even our faith.</code></pre>

				<blockquote>Our Lord Jesus has never lost a battle. There is this little song that we sing:<br />
In heaven He won the battle<br />
On earth He won the battle<br />
In the grave He won the battle<br />
Jesus Christ the Son of God</blockquote>
<br />
<br />
The mind of Christ sees victory all the time and that is what He declares everytime. He told the disciples who went on assignment for the kingdom with signs and wonders following that He saw the devil falling like a lightening from heaven. As far as our Lord Jesus is concerned, the devil is defeated already. We as believers are on an enforcement mission to actualize our victory. Amen
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Our Bible study yesterday would put a lot of matters at rest. As kingdom citizens, it is necessary and mandatory that we live by the kingdom mentality. You don’t live in God’s kingdom thinking like a helpless person on earth. You always need a reinforcement of your confidence in all situations by the enabling word of God to possess your possession in Christ. That is why we give ourselves to the word of God as we daily search for the treasures that bring us pleasures in the scriptures. It is in the presence of God that fullness of joy is located. If we can ignite His presence, we can ignore the plans of the wicked. Are you not surprised that Jesus Christ never commanded the devil to release any of the dead people He raised to life? He just called forth the son of the widow of Nain and He did the same with Lazarus. Jesus Christ was operating far above death because He is the resurrection and the life. He did not need to mind the devil when he asked Him to turn stone to bread because He Himself is the bread of life. Why would He need to turn stone to what He is already? The wisdom of God is our first victory over the devil and his plans.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We overcome when we possess the mind of Christ. And this is no mean task. We are surrounded with so many occurrences in this world that have the capacity to paralyze our faith. However, we must not allow the fire of our faith to be quenched because therein lies our victory. Let us continue to explore the word of life as we allow it to dwell in us richly. The word of God never expires. The more we put our faith in the word of God the more victories we shall see. Let us see victory as Jesus see victory and we shall have unending testimonies. Rejoice in the Lord.
