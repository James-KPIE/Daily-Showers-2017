				Another way of looking at the issue of idolatry is to ask who your lord is. Your lord is the person or thing that controls your life. Your lord is that person or thing that occupies your mind and the attention of your heart. The direction to which your resources go also determines who your God is. There are people who struggle to give their money towards kingdom projects but would rather spend money on clothings and ornaments that carry no eternal
value. Some men are enslaved by illicit sex such that they spend more money on their sinner female friends than on their legitimate wives. Your money will always go to where your heart is, no more no less.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				God is the Creator of us all but He is not Lord over all our lives. If God cannot control your life by His word, if your actions are not influenced by the word of God, then He remains only God to you and we cannot say that you belong to Him. And this is a serious matter. God does not relate with those who are only His creatures as He relates with those who are both His creatures and His children by covenant. Acts 3:25 makes it clear that those who are born again are both children of the prophets and of the covenant. Until Abraham responded to God’s call, he was just a man before God, like other men who are not connected to God by covenant. As he continued to respond to God through obedience, God became the LORD to him. In Genesis 15:1, God spoke to Abraham as the LORD. Abraham had yielded the control of his life to God and the Almighty God had become his Commander–in–chief. Then, the LORD came to tell him that He would be Abraham’s <b>harvest</b> because Abraham’s life had become a seed in His hand. When your life becomes a <b>seed</b> in God’s hand, He becomes your harvest and that is my interpretation of Genesis 15:1. Is your life a seed in God’s hand?

				<p>
				Many Christians keep on struggling because God has not become their Lord. God is not the Lord in their home because the husband runs the home by his native culture and masculine philosophy rather than by the commandments of God. Many Christian businessmen are far from God in the way they run their businesses and they want God to bless such businesses. We shall continue on this issue tomorrow. However, you must answer this candid question–Is God the Lord over your life? How much of your life is influenced by the word of the Lord? Rejoice in the Lord.
