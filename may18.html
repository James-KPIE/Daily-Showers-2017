				Faith thrives on persistence. Our Lord Jesus Christ told us in Luke 18:1 that we ought always to pray and not to faint. Another version of the Bible says “not to give up.” True worship has a way of rejuvenating or renewing our faith. Many of us have sometimes
been in situations where our faith was low and it seemed like we did not know what next to do. Then we crawled into the theater of worship and began to express worship to God, telling Him ‘You are the I Am that I Am,’ You are the Most High, You are the King of kings, You are the Ancient of days, the Rock of ages, the Fear of Isaac, the Strength of Jacob, the Ruler of the Universe, You are Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of peace, the Rose of Sharon, Omnipotent God, Omnipresent God and Omniscient God, the Bright and Morning star and so on. Gradually, you will begin to experience a quickening of your spirit and a gradual boosting of your faith. Worship boosts faith because it keeps all your focus on God.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The woman in the passage which we read for today’s devotion was not from Israel, so she was naturally out of favour for the kind of attention a Jew should get. Nonetheless, two things helped her. She was persistent. The second issue is that in the middle of her pleading with Jesus, she suddenly remembered to worship the Lord Jesus Christ. So she went on her knees and the entire encounter took a new turn. She got more strength for her faith to ask and brought forth one of the most persuasive argument anyone ever presented before Jesus Christ. Finally, the act of worship turned the ‘no’ of the Master to ‘yes’ and the Master commended her faith as He gave her the miracle.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Anytime you are weary, even weary to turn to your Bible to read, immediately, crawl into the presence of God in worship. Begin to call Him His names and proceed to tell of the greatness of His might. You will find joy and strength and because it is with joy that you draw blessings out of the well of salvation (Isaiah 12:3), you will not lack the faith to receive from the throne of grace. Worship creates access for you and helps your faith which is the currency by which all heavenly transactions are conducted. Worship is the privilege of the saints and we must, daily, engage in authentic worship of the Almighty God. Rejoice in the Lord.
