So then it is not of him 
that willeth, nor
of him that runneth, 
but of God that
sheweth mercy.</code></pre>

					We are still considering the power of One and today we shall look at the work of divine sovereignty as far as individuals are concerned, in His agenda for our lives. I must admit that this is one area that we all have limited understanding about because God’s
ways are past finding out. When we read 1 Samuel 2:7 and Psalm 115:3 we will have an idea that the best we can do is to obey God’s instructions, live a holy life unto Him and expect the best from Him. I have studied Ecclesiasts 9:11 times and again. According to this last scripture our abilities and efforts are not the ultimate determinants of our success and prosperity. God says those things are determined by time and chance. To me, that speaks of opportunity. God is sovereign. Our times are in His hand. We can only pray daily that He shows us mercy and guide us by His loving kindness.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In our walk with God, we must be careful not to imitate other people but to depend on God for direction and expect His blessing on what we do. As a secondary school student, I went to play in the company of my three other friends one afternoon many years ago. Then we saw a motorbike that was parked by the owner at the back of a house. To catch some fun, each of my friends had a ride in turn for several minutes. When it was my turn, the owner (an old man) came out from the house where he had come apparently to visit someone. He caught me on his bike and decided to take me to the police station. All my friends ran away. On the way to the station, he asked for the name of my father and I told him. Then he stopped, shook his head and said my father was a respectable man with great influence whom he would not want to offend. Then, he released me. None of my friends was caught, yet we committed the same offence.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The reverse is true when the heaven of one man opens because he is singled out, while other people around him may continue to labour under closed heaven. It does not mean that he is holier or more righteous than the others. God can single you out for a blessing as He did for the widow of Zarephat or the Syrian army general named Naaman. Inspite of his pride even before the prophet, he got his healing. God singles individuals out for blessing as an act of His sovereignty. May that be your testimony. Amen. Rejoice in the Lord.
