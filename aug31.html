            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Matt. 24:30</strong> <br>                         
And then shall
appear the sign of the
Son of man in heaven: and then
shall all the tribes of
the earth mourn, and
they shall see the Son
of man coming in the
clouds of heaven with
power and great glory.</code></pre>

				<p>If nothing moves us to be involved in kingdom evangelism, we should be moved by what God can say to us when we arrive in heaven. I like the song that says:
<blockquote>When we all get to heaven<br />
What a day of rejoicing that will be<br />
When we all see Jesus<br />
We will sing and shout the victory</blockquote>
However, beyond the song and shout of victory is the welcome
comments of our Lord Jesus, the Bishop of our souls. Will He embrace you and I and say <blockquote>‘Welcome, faithful and wise servant?’</blockquote> Will He pass by our side as if He did not notice us? Whatever will happen then is determined now by the things that we do while we are still here on this side of eternity.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				What is meant by <b>faithful</b> and <b>wise</b> servant? It is not all servants that are faithful. Faithfulness requires following the Master wholeheartedly. It requires that the business of the Master is given our total commitment. The faithful servant gives his all to the Master’s business and takes worthy risks by placing his talents and treasures on line for the use of the Master. The faithful servant does not betray the Master nor will he engage in eye-service. The faithful servant does not cut corners or allow a conflict of interest between his business and that of the Master. A faithful servant does not use the Master’s personality to project his own image rather he projects the Master’s image only. A faithful servant maintains integrity. A faithful servant gives sacrificially to the Master’s business.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				In the same vein, the wise servant obeys the Master totally and completely even when the instruction of the Master does not sound wise to human mind. The wise servant knows that disobedience is the wisdom of the fool and obedience is the foolishness of the wise. So, the wise servant does those things which look foolish to the world but in doing such things, heaven reckons him as wise. To forgive him who wrongs you, to pay your tithe, to give out what is not enough and so on may appear foolish to the sinner but to us, they are wisdom. We are wise when we obey those unpopular demands of the word of God such as not getting married to a man if you are a man, and a woman not getting married to another woman. With God, wisdom shall be justified by its product when we get to heaven. Rejoice in the Lord.
