            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: John 1:6-13 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: John. 8:36</strong> <br>                         
If the Son therefore shall 
make you free, ye shall 
be free indeed.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				We must follow the path which the Lord has chosen for us to experience the liberty which redemption has brought for us. Many people languish in hardship and suffering today because they are unwilling to be free. Their unwillingness is demonstrated by their willful
resistance to the voice of the Lord which has commanded them to take steps that will lead to their freedom. God does not force His will on us because He had said in Genesis 6:3 that His Spirit will not strive with us. But when our spirit strives with our Maker, we are in trouble. That is why the Bible says woe to the man that strives with his maker.
<br /><br />
Many people would have been healed but they would not because they are not ready for God to heal them. One of the ways people demonstrate their unwillingness is through unbelief. In Mark 6:5 the Bible says that Jesus Christ did not do mighty miracles in Nazareth because of their unbelief. The people in that city were too familiar with Jesus Christ. They asked <blockquote>“Is this not the carpenter?”</blockquote> They saw Jesus as an ordinary citizen of their native land and they could not place a demand on His anointing through faith. So, those who were sick among them delayed the healing they would have gotten.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				I heard a funny but true story of a sister who was ill recently. She was brought before the man of God who asked her whether she wanted to be healed and she said ‘no.’ The man of God asked her why? She answered and said that when she was alright her husband used to come home very late from work because he would go to a club after the working hours and spend the whole evening there. She said all that changed since she got ill and her husband had been coming home straight from work. Funny, isn’t it? Another woman who was apparently demon–possessed refused deliverance because her powers made her husband do whatever she asked him to do. For example, she said, her husband would drive her to her concubine’s house and he would park the car and sit inside the car while she went to meet her sinful partner. When she had finished all she wanted to do, she would come down from the house and her husband would drive her back home. The devil can really mess those who are his victims!
				</p>
				
				<p>
				When a person is unwilling to be free, he or she suffers delay in getting out of his or her predicament. Pride almost denied and delayed General Naaman’s healing too. You must be willing when the Lord is ready. Rejoice in the Lord.
