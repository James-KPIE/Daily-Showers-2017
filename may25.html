            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Josh. 24:15</strong> <br>                         

He that dwelleth in the 
secret place of the 
most High shall abide 
under the shadow 
of the Almighty.</code></pre>

				Worship can be seen from two angles. We have worship in the strict or narrow sense and worship from the broad or corporate perspective. In the strict sense, worship is the totality of our consecration, dedication and devotion. When we live only to the pleasure of God and God is pleased with us,
then we can say we are true worshippers of God. In the broad sense, we can express worship in some practical terms such as through our words of adoration unto God or even through our singing and dancing. Basically, when we do such things with the objective of exalting God for who He is, we say we are worshipping God. This is where worship and praise appear to be the same thing. The difference is that through praise; generally speaking we appreciate God for His doings–the miracles, the signs, the wonders and His benevolence. In one, we celebrate God for who He is; in the other, we celebrate Him for what He has done.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Our focus in yesterday’s sermon was on worship in the strict sense and we continue on that today. The place of personal worship is called the secret place. It is secret because it is a reserved place for you to meet with your Maker all alone. It is the place where you can open your whole life to God without any shame. It is the place to tell God your deepest needs and the agitations in your spirit. It is a place where you do not grant admission to any distractions so you can feast on God’s Word alone and God can have your total attention. The secret place of worship is the place where you take instructions for the making of your destiny and hear God speak to you directly as a close friend does to his friend. It is the place where the deep talks to the deep. It is a place of revelation. It is a place where God can show you the picture of the future. What you receive in the secret place influences your life in the open place and structures the kind of life you want to live. If a man’s life follows no consistent pattern being a believer, it simply means that he has not been to the secret place. Men of the secret place are reserved to a great degree and they are deep. Every man’s destiny is to be shaped in the secret place.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				If you have not been to the secret place, you can begin today. The secret place is where you receive supernatural shock absorbers for the challenges of the end–time. Echoes from the secret place will always be “It shall be well.” Rejoice in the Lord.
