					When God guides a man, He would always arrange men and women who will aid him in his journey to get to his destiny in life. That is why it is the wisest thing to seek God and stick with Jesus. Thank God for the life of Joseph who knew and acknowledged God
very early and stayed holy unto Him. God had a great destiny for him but the enemies of his household attempted to abort that great destiny. However, God frustrated every such evil agenda and used the enemies’ wicked push to move him closer and closer to his destiny until he reached the top. Joseph’s case is a classical example of a man who enjoys divine support which all opposition in hell cannot undo.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					We can stand on God’s sure promises as we take our stand in Christ’s righteousness. There is a guarantee of divine guidance for the righteous. In several cases in the Bible, God upheld His own children against all the fiery darts of the wicked. Is it not amazing that God used even Reuben to save Joseph from being killed? Judah also followed up his counsel and advised the wicked brothers to sell Joseph into slavery rather than kill him. God has raised ‘saviours’ for his people in the past, even amongst the very conspirators. May be that was the reason whyJudah was raised to number one position among all the children of Jacob according to Genesis 49:10 while Reuben was spared to live by the prophecy of Moses in Deuteronomy 33:6.
				</p>
				
				<p>
The Lord’s promise is to guide us with His eyes upon us. We cannot be stranded when we abandon our destiny into the able hands of the Almighty. Even while Joseph was wandering in the desert looking for his brothers in order to give them food, he was not permitted, by God, to be stranded. In Genesis 37:15-17, a certain man <b>found</b> him. He gave Joseph direction. When he was sold to the Midianites as a <b>slave</b>, he landed in Potiphar’s house and the officer of Pharaoh <b>found</b> Joseph to be a special person who succeeded in whatever he did because God was with him (Genesis 39:3). When he was thrown into the prison through injustice, there again the keeper of the prisoner <b>found</b> him a unique person and he made room for him. In the prison, he had the opportunity to use God’s gift in his life and that lifted him to the palace. Stay with God and you will not be stranded. If the whole world is against you, let God be with you and you are sure to prevail. Rejoice in the Lord.
