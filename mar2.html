And he said, Lay not thine hand upon 
the lad, neither do thou anything unto 
him: for now I know that thou fearest 
God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy 
son, thine only son from me.</code></pre>

				The eighth covenant credential of Abraham was that he feared God. It was not the fear of God’s judgment. Rather, it was the fear of reverent love, the kind that makes the heart of a man so loved to tremble before the great loving God, in awe of Him. You don’t want to hurt the person you truly love. The more you appreciate God’s unmerited love for you, the more you want to run away from those things that will hurt your relationship with
Him. No reasonable person would want to attack his helper. God is the helper of the helpless and our ever–present help in the time of need. He is all we need; to have all our needs met.<br /><br />
It was in Genesis 22:12 that God precisely told us about this credential of Abraham and over the years, Bible teachers have given little attention to this principal characteristic whenever they speak of Abraham. We call him the father of faith but we don’t emphasize that he feared God. The Almighty God was so proud of Abraham that He boasted that He could trust him according to Genesis 18:19. God cannot walk with a man who cannot be trusted. If we don’t fear God, we will not be trustworthy. It is the fear of God that restrains a man from doing evil. Proverbs 16:6 says it is by the fear of God that a man departs from iniquity. Those who do not fear God can hardly hold unto their integrity when they occupy a position of responsibility.<br /><br />
A man who does not fear God cannot be a good husband. He could provide money but withhold affection. He can be a wife–beater. The wife who does not fear God may hurl insults on her husband at will and thereby bring a curse upon her own head. The root of all kinds of corruption and wickedness is lack of the fear of God. You cannot fear God and take a knife to slash the throat of a fellow human being in the name of any religion. That is purely satanic. You cannot fear God and approve of what God says He hates. To God, only those who fear Him are wise. Others are foolish.<br /><br />
God asks us to follow after Abraham according to Isaiah 51:2. If we look unto Abraham as our example we will do what he did. He feared God. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
