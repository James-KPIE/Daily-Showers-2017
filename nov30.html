            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Matt. 11:29</strong> <br>                         
Take my yoke upon you,
and learn of me; for I am
meek and lowly in heart:
and ye shall find rest
unto your souls.</code></pre>

				<p>
				We have explored the mind of Christ for the past one month although it is inexhaustible. We will continue to do this from time to time. Indeed when we study the Bible and meditate on the word of God what we are doing is that we are exploring God’s mind. The word of God is the expression of His mind in the written form over all issues of life. That
is why we tried in the course of this month to do a random exploration as it were hoping to find answers to some questions about life and to help ourselves to stay on the track of salvation so our soul can remain secure in Christ.
<br /><br /> 
The principal reason why we all need to study the mind of Christ is to be able to pattern our lives after Him and find rest for our souls. Paul was determined to live and relate with the mind of Christ at all times. He told the Corinthians Church in1 Corinthians 2:2 “For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ and Him crucified.” Jesus was the cornerstone of Paul’s ministry. Jesus was the theme in all His writings. Indeed, he wrote in Philippians 1:21 <blockquote><b>“For me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.”</b></blockquote> Christ must be the centre of our lives. Until that is established, we cannot be at peace with God. Jesus is our example in all things.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				As we study the mind of Christ, we can know what He would do in any situation and as His disciples (not just His followers) we can do what He would do in different situations and that will position us for the victorious Christian life. For example we know that Jesus has forgiven our sins. We are beneficiaries of His mercy. If we think on this we will find out that there is no offence which is as terrible as the sin we were guilty of for which Jesus offered His life as an atonement. Therefore it becomes easy for us to forgive those who offend us. Forgiveness is the seed for relationship. We who are born again are reconciled to the Father because we are forgiven. Offences that are allowed to linger when they are not forgiven can and will hurt relationships. It is beyond me how brethren can dwell together when there are offences which are not forgiven.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We will do well to always ask what Jesus would do whenever and in whatever situation we find ourselves. Would He lie? Would He fight? Would He keep malice? Would He give bribe? Would He beat His wife if He were married or would He abandon His responsibilities to His family? We will live the true Christian life if we always ask these questions. Rejoice in the Lord.
