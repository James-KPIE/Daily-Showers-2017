            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Lk. 18:1</strong> <br>                         
And he spake a
parable unto them to
this end, that men
ought always to pray,
and not to faint;</code></pre>

					Prayer is a heavenly business transacted on earth. Effective prayers require the connectivity between the mortal and the immortal. Faith is the activator of the engine of prayer. Our prayers are wingless without faith. Of course holiness is also a fundamental
factor because it aligns our nature with God’s nature such that we can relate with God spiritually according to Amos 3:3. From Psalm 66:18 and Isaiah 59:1-2, the scripture makes it clear to us that sin will hinder our prayers just as Proverbs 15:8 says that the sacrifice (prayer is an act of self-denial) of the wicked is an abomination unto God. Proverbs 13:15 says that the way of the transgressor is hard. Part of the hardness in the way of the sinner is the unrewarded labour on the altar of prayers.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					We pray so many prayers at the theater of prayers but times of prayers may be a waste if they are not prayed according to the will of God and according to the principles laid down in the scripture. I believe that every person who approaches the place of prayer needs some preparations to make and at least one preliminary prayer to pray. We ought to pray first that as we approach the throne of grace, God should be gracious to us and help us to pray only the prayers that He will answer. This is necessary because most people go to pray to fulfill righteousness whereas prayer is first and foremost an opportunity to connect to God. When we are connected to God, prayer becomes a relational exercise rather than a trial and error case. In some cases, we have been told to shout so loud as if God does not hear silent prayers. He hears both. When the heart is right and faith is alive and we pray according to God’s will, answer to our prayer will not be determined by the input of our labour or the quantum of our sweat.
				</p>

					Jabez prayed only one prayer and God answered and turned his life around. He prayed for grace, greatness, guidance and goodness and he never needed to pray the same prayer again. A friend of mine once said that the solution to your problem may be one prayer away. It is so sweet to pray just one prayer and receive an answer, a turnaround. May that be your testimony. Rejoice in the Lord.
