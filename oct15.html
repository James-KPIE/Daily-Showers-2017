            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Pro. 10:4</strong> <br>                         
He becometh poor that dealeth 
with a slack hand: but the 
hand of the diligent 
maketh rich.</code></pre>

				Laziness is a precursor to stagnation and penury. Laziness will not only delay progress, it can destroy destiny and make a man useless to his generation. Laziness is often a product of lack of self–motivation. And let no one blame the devil for his woes if he is lazy. The lazy man will always find excuses for his miseries but there is
really no explanation for laziness. Indolence is often apparent especially where opportunities are not lacking. A lazy man squanders opportunities and blames everyone for his woes. Most often, a lazy man begs and when he does not receive he becomes angry at people and points a finger at everyone and accuses people around him as uncaring and tight fisted. A lazy man is a liability to the people around him and he can hardly be of any benefit to anyone.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The first important lesson a lazy man should learn is that nothing works unless we work it. Our salvation is free for example but we are told to work it out according to Philippians 2:12. We cannot just sit by and watch because we are saved. There are discoveries we must make by the light which redemption had shed on our hearts. You cannot maximize your destiny in Christ if you are lazy to pray and to read the Bible daily. And when you read the Bible you must read it with all the attention you can muster and with prayer to the Holy Spirit to open your eyes to see the deeper things in His word. In the gospel adventure, whatever you find is yours forever. We are to search the scriptures according to Isaiah 34:16. We must diligently apply the truth which we find therein to ourselves and our situations according to Job 5:27. Of course we need to inject faith into the word so as to tap into its profits according to Hebrews 4:2. We must store the word in our hearts according to Proverbs 10:14 so that we can draw upon it whenever we need it. Christianity is no fun. It is real work.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Many people today are paying for their laziness in their younger days. A little more push could have placed them at an advantageous position today. But many people were just satisfied with their little comfort and they stayed with it and since they did not ‘grow’ themselves by stretching themselves to do more, their status did not change. So, laziness has kept them at the same level. <b>Lazy people often stop at the zone of least resistance.</b> But people who make giant strides are those who contend with the forces of limitation whatever they may be and persistence in their pursuit brings them into the place of comfort and greatness. Shun laziness. Rejoice in the Lord.
