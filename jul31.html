            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Genesis 41:38-46 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Gen. 41:44</strong> <br>                         
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, 
I am Pharaoh, and without 
thee shall no man lift up 
his hand or foot in all 
the land of Egypt.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				The promotion of the favoured child of God is certain even if it suffers delay. Joseph’s destiny was held down for thirteen years but he was favoured to be lifted up to the highest position in Egypt. God is not man. Indeed, He is the Lord who can do anything. He can work out His purpose anyhow and anywhere. I do not know whether you ever wondered how the Lord fixed Joseph’s case. He had dreamt in Canaan and
everyone, including his brothers, thought his glory could only show forth in their homeland. In order to abort that, they sold him out. Joseph was the first stranger to occupy the office of Prime Minister in Egypt. It was like God saying ‘O.K, if you want to stop Joseph’s reign in Canaan, I will make him to rule in Egypt. By divine arrangement, Pharaoh was reigning and Joseph was ruling and there was no conflict. God has power to overrule the enemy’s calculations concerning your affairs. He does what He pleases in heaven and on earth. The Lord shocked Joseph’s brothers when they saw him on the throne in Egypt. You cannot demote a man who God has promoted.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				David was also a man who was confined to the backside of the desert to waste away and no one, probably himself inclusive, ever thought he would mount the throne anywhere. His father who had forgotten him, could not have recommended him for any position of honour. However, the Bible says in Psalm 75:6 that promotion comes from the Lord. The wonderful thing is that if your promotion comes from above, the Lord will see to it that the enemy would not be able to “rubbish” it. God stood beside David to enjoy the opulence that came from his exaltation. Just like Joseph who did not persecute those who were responsible for the delay in his journey of life, David did not use his promotion to get even with the enemies of his progress. He even sought out Mephiboseth the grandson of Saul and made him to eat at his table in the palace.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<b>When the adversary plots to hinder your promotion, walk closer to God.</b> Don’t fight for promotion in the flesh. Don’t pursue favoritism but let the Lord of heaven work out your promotion by His favour. He lifted Joseph and David up to their thrones. Wait on Him and He will surely do your own. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
