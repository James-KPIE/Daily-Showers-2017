            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Deut. 6:5</strong> <br>                         
And thou shalt love the LORD 
thy God with all thine heart, 
and with all thy soul, and 
with all thy might.</code></pre>

				Our commitment to God’s kingdom is the guarantee of our security as citizens of the kingdom. That is the reason why we cannot be on-lookers or develop apathy to the matters of the kingdom. At various times we have considered the stories of Moses, David and Paul to mention a
few of the God’s generals in the Bible. Each of them blazed the trail as pioneers and pace-setters in areas where their very lives were in great danger. Yet, they were all preserved and achieved phenomenal goals because the Caller, the King of the kingdom whose interests they sought was with them. Recall for example how David overcame Goliath. With no experience in the battlefield as a trained soldier it took ‘supernatural’ guts for David to dare Goliath when for forty days the very trained army of Israel could not come to face the giant.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				When we are committed to God’s kingdom business on earth, the kingdom power is made available to us not only for exploits but for protection in the form of kingdom immunity. No one fights the kingdom battle at his or her own expense. The story of Daniel which we consider today shows us that God is always behind those who are ‘sold out’ for the kingdom on the earth. Daniel grew up very early in the Hebrew family to know Yahweh. We are told in Daniel 6:10 that it was his custom since his early days to wake up and get to the altar where he would pray and seek the face of the Lord for the new day. He carried that practice into Babylon in a land of captivity. He stood before God and God stayed with him.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The triumph which Daniel witnessed over the power of the lions was the demonstration of the Lord’s commitment to a faithful servant. God is able to deliver those who trust in Him. However, we must go beyond trusting in our heart and in our prayer. We must carry our trust into the vineyard of the Lord where we must enroll in kingdom service. We shall consider that from tomorrow. God is still in the business of shutting the mouths of lions, even spiritual lions for the sake of His people. He is still making the fire of the wicked to be of no power over His children as well. Don’t delay. Don’t be a casual Christian. Plunge into kingdom service for the security of your destiny. Rejoice in the Lord.
