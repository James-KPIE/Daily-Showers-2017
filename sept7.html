            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Gen. 18:14</strong> <br>                         
Is anything too hard for 
the LORD? At the time 
appointed I will return 
unto thee, according to 
the time of life, and 
Sarah shall have a son.</code></pre>

				God works in mysterious ways to perform His wonders. We cannot see Him but we can see His works. Our access to His wonders is through His words. His word reveals His nature to us and God’s nature is unchanging. Hebrews 13:8 says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever. In Malachi 3:6, God said: <blockquote>“I am the Lord, I change not.”</blockquote> We can exercise our faith in the truth of God’s unchanging
nature to tap into the power of any change that we desire in our circumstances. When we connect to the Spirit of faith, we enter into the realm of boundless possibilities in Christ.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Both Abraham and Sarah his wife laughed at God’s repeated promise that they would have a child; each laughed at different times. Their laughter did not make God angry. Their laughter was like saying to God ‘Look at this our old bodies, is a child going to come from these bodies?’ God must have taken their laughter to be a call on God from the corridor of faith. That was the expression in Elijah’s words on Mount Carmel. He called on God to prove Himself. Every time we gather to seek the Lord’s face for an intervention wherein we take His promises to Him to perform, what we are saying to God is that He should prove Himself. And that is the farthest we can go. God is bound by the word He has spoken although He is absolutely sovereign and may change His mind as He did concerning the family of Eli in 1 Samuel 2:30, yet we can always call on Him to prove Himself in our situation according to the word which He has spoken.
				</p>
				
				<p>
We can charge our faith’s battery by the word of solution which the Lord has spoken. For example, when God told Abraham that it was not a hard thing for God to make Sarah fruitful, that was the end of the matter. Faith will pick those words and begin to speak forth positively. That was why Abraham no longer staggered in faith but he turned his prayers into worship, giving glory to God (Romans 4:20-22). When Mary heard the angel in Luke 1:37 when he said that nothing shall be impossible with God, that was another word that put an end to all doubts and anxiety. We can also position ourselves in the same way that Abraham and Mary did if we can receive the written word as the word for our own similar situation. Very soon our miracle shall be delivered. That is how to make your faith effectual. Rejoice in the Lord.
