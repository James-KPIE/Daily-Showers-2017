The righteous shall flourish 
like the palm tree: he shall 
grow like a cedar in Lebanon.</code></pre>

				The benefits of being a friend of God are uncountable. To be a friend of God is to be righteous as it was under the law or to be made righteous through the righteousness of Jesus Christ by faith, under the present dispensation to grace. To be a friend of God is to subscribe to absolute obedience to His commands
and the keeping of His laws. That is why Jesus Christ defined our friendship with Him with reference to obedience. You may be a regular church goer, a tither, a big time giver or contributor to church projects but if you are not obedient to the word of God, you are not His friend. See John 15:14.<br /><br />
Abraham was a friend of God because He obeyed God and the reward he got from God is beyond human understanding. The much we can understand from Genesis 15:1 account of the reward of their friendship is that God stood for everything Abraham would ever need. God made His all available to Abraham. When God becomes your reward, you will find favour and succour everywhere you turn. No one refuses such a person. Your word will become a command in the company of men. When Abraham wanted to buy land to bury his wife in Hebron, they refused to sell to him and preferred to give it to him for free but for his insistence. They told him in Genesis 23:6: “you are a mighty prince in our midst.” A friend of God enjoys divine backing in whatever he does. The protection and security of God form a shield around the righteous who is a friend of God. Whatever he does prospers and his life will not witness a season of drought. A friend of God has nothing to fear.<br /><br />
However, a friend of God must also be of value to His kingdom. Therefore, a friend of God must be a soul winner. That is the greatest work you can do for God. A friend of God must proclaim the kingdom everywhere he goes through his character. Indeed, Christ–likeness is the hallmark of genuine Christianity. A friend of God must love what God loves and hate what God hates. To befriend God is a great responsibility. When people see us, they should see Christ. If that is not yet true of you, then you need more work to do and Jesus would do it if you go back to Him. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
