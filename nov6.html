            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Isaiah 14:2</strong> <br>                         
And the people shall take
them, and bring them to
their place: and the
house of Israel shall
possess them in the land
of the LORD for servants
and handmaids: and they
shall take them captives,
whose captives they
were; and they shall rule
over their oppressors.</code></pre>

				<p>
				The mind of Christ in us is above oppression. John 3:31 says that he that is from above is above all. He who is born of the Spirit is the person from above and this refers to the born again child of God. In John 3:6 Jesus Christ said that he that is born of the Spirit is spirit. We attain a new spiritual status at redemption. We are raised together with Christ and we dwell in the high places far above principalities and powers (Ephesians 2:5-6). The devil oppresses the mind of the unsaved at will. However, it is not so with the redeemed of the Lord. By the power of the Holy Spirit in us we can resist all manners of oppression by the devil by
watching the ‘gates’ in our lives. The gates include majorly our eyes, our ears, our mouth and our hearts.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The Spirit of God in us can help us to keep our eyes under control by resisting the temptation to watch those things which may pollute our hearts. We must mind what we read generally in these days where there is so much offensive publications especially on the internet. We are told that terrorists use the internet to appeal to their victims who they lure to join them through the art of brainwashing. Unfortunately, those who refuse to read the word of God that is the Bible will read other satanic books. A book is not satanic by the name it is called, a book is satanic because of its inspiration. The Holy Spirit is the author of the Bible because He inspired the authors to write the books therein. It is not so with other books. That is why people read such books and take to violence even though their readers claim to preach peace. Every act of violence is by the inspiration of Satan. Beware.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We can also stay above oppression by listening to goodnews only. We must insist on hearing such messages that exhort us unto Godliness and the fear of God, love and righteousness. Don’t listen to communications that will corrupt your mind or pollute your heart. Stay away from poor and corrupt talkers who may want to coopt you into the group of careless talkers. Sinful and corrupt communication is more easily learned than righteous conversation. It is far cheaper to learn evil than to learn good. Jesus has exchanged oppression with dominion for us on the cross. This is fourth supernatural exchange which He perfected on the cross. Put your faith in the perfect work of Christ and walk in dominion anywhere on the face of the earth. The tide has been turned on your behalf. You will now begin to oppress the powers which used to oppress you and be a captor to your former captors. Rejoice in the Lord.
