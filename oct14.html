            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Mk. 9:23</strong> <br>                         
Jesus said unto him, If 
thou canst believe, all 
things are possible 
to him that believeth.</code></pre>

				<p>
				We lose when we doubt that God will do what He has promised to do. I think the reason why believers doubt the manifestation of what God had promised is because many of us are not stable in the spirit. You see, we are re–created through redemption to become spirit beings and to dwell in the spirit realm in the kingdom of God (John 3:6-8, Ephesians
2:5-6 and Philippians 3:20). The moves of God in our lives are limited by the permission we grant the Holy Spirit to rule our lives (Ephesians 3:20). If we are born again but we continue to dwell in the flesh (that is our minds are occupied by the things which are worldly and carnal), then we are not operating with the mind of Christ and when that happens, there is a disconnect between us and God. When our spirit is disconnected from the Spirit of God, there will be faith paralysis and doubts set in and cause us not to be able to receive from God.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				In our reading passage today Jesus Christ emphasized the need not to doubt. Indeed, doubt is sin, according to Romans 14:23. Doubt and unbelief are the enemies of faith. The permanent cure for doubt is to maintain an unswerving focus on God and not on ourselves or our circumstances or the size of the challenge that we face. If David had concentrated on the size of Goliath, he would have frozen and his faith in God would have melted away. But David worshipped God, exalted Him in recounting the past victories which God had given to him, and he staked his faith on the testimonies of God. He made no reference to Goliath except when he said that God would give Goliath into their (Israelites’) hands (1 Kings 17:47).
				</p>
				
				<p>
				There are Christians who come to the place of prayers to magnify their problems rather than magnify God. They come in to show to God how big their challenges are, rather than come enthusiastically with the mentality of winners that they are in Christ, to show to their challenges how big the God they serve is. <b>Whenever you operate with the underdog mentality you may squander the victory which Jesus Christ has given you in redemption.</b> You see, that victory is established but it is not guaranteed. God’s part is the part that is established but your own part must be done to see the desired manifestation. If you refuse to believe and to obey and you permit doubt in your heart, you may frustrate a divine agenda. Doubt your doubt and believe God without wavering. Rejoice in the Lord.
