            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Heb. 11:8</strong> <br>                         

By faith Abraham, when 
he was called to go out 
into a place which he 
should after receive for 
an inheritance, obeyed; 
and he went out, not knowing 
whither he went.</code></pre>

				<p>
				Obedience is the proof of faith. You cannot claim to believe the word which you refuse to obey. Therefore, faith is responsibility. If you say you have faith, you should show us the proof by the things you do in response to the Word of life. Faith implies an acceptance of scriptural responsibility in our quest to tap into the spiritual blessings contained in the Word. Moreover, as I said sometime ago, you can only be said to believe in that part of the word of God which you put into practice through
obedience. For example, if you do not pay your tithe and you claim to believe in tithing, the confession of your faith in that regard is fake. You cannot claim to believe in forgiveness if you withhold it from those who offend you. The proof that you believe in God’s love is best displayed when love proceeds from you to other people around you just as you love God too.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				In 1 Kings 17:8-16, the widow of Zarephat displayed the kind of faith we are talking about today. Elijah came to the woman when she was fetching firewood to cook the last meal which she had. It was .going to be the last meal she and her son would eat and die. Elijah asked her to make some cake for him first with a promise by God that the content of both the barrel of meal and the cruise of oil would not be exhausted. Thank God the woman believed. She obeyed the servant of God and it turned out just as Elijah had spoken (verse 16). If she did not do what Elijah asked her to do, there would be no proof that she believed in the word the man of God had spoken.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Many people claim they believe in God but their problem is to do what His Word requires. Saul lost the dynasty due to disobedience. He was asked to wait for the priest to come and handle the sacrifice but he usurped the authority when he felt the priest had delayed his coming. Obedience that proves faith must be complete. It must be patient where patience is necessary. It must act where action is required and it must refrain from acting where inaction is the appropriate thing. Let us watch out for our actions in obedience to God’s Word. The best proof that we have faith is to obey what the Word of God commands. No more, no less. Rejoice in the Lord.
