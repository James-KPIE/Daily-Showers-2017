            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: James 5:11-12 </h3>
            <pre><code>M.V: Gen. 18:19<b style="color:red"></b> <br>                         
For I know him, that <br>he will command his <br>children and his household <br>after him, and they shall <br>keep the way of the LORD, <br>to do justice and judgment; <br>that the LORD may bring upon <br>Abraham that which he hath spoken <br>of him.</code></pre>Integrity of heart is a major requirement under the kingdom covenant reward system. A common definition of integrity is the state of being whole, entire, or undiminished. It is adherence to moral and ethical principles; soundness of moral character; honesty. A man of integrity can be trusted to do what he has promised he would do. Promptness in delivering services and punctuality in the place of any consignment are all issues of integrity. Integrity is the product of high level of self –discipline. That<br>is why Paul said that he disciplined his body not only to keep away<br>from sin but to honour every promise he made.<b> It is a matter of integrity for a man of God to keep every appointment for which he has given his word and to be on time for such an engagement.</b><br><br>A man cannot be faithful at work without maintaining integrity. The quality of work or performance from each worker hinges on integrity. Integrity requires that there be no shady financial dealings or conflicts of interest where you work. It requires that you give account for all transactions to the last kobo or cent or penny. An office clerk was sent on an errand around the Lagos city in Nigeria many years ago. His boss gave him ten shillings to pick a taxi in order to fast-track his movements. He took a bus and saved a lot of money. On his return later in the day, he returned nine shillings to his boss. Everyone in the office jeered at his foolishness for not helping himself with the rest of the money. The boss also wondered at his behaviour but took the money from him. Several years later the accounting firm wanted to establish another office in a city outside the capital city of Nigeria. Then the boss remembered the young clerk with integrity. He was sent to oversee the new office as the manager. Integrity promotes because it earns trust for you. Trust also commands opportunities.<br><br>Nothing is as valuable as integrity at work. Trust is your ticket to the top in the market place. Skill can be a waste if you cannot be trusted. God trusted Abraham because of integrity. Can He speak concerning you as He did for Abraham?<div
