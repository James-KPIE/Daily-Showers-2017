            <h4 align="right">Sun. December 31, 2017</h4>
            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Psalm 47 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Ps. 95:6</strong> <br>                         
O come, let us worship
and bow down: let us
kneel before the LORD
our maker.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				Gratitude. Yes, gratitude is what we owe to God today for keeping us all alive to see the end of another memorable year. As with the perilous years, the wind blew, the thunder struck, there were accidents in many places and several people who started the year with us are
gone. There were occasions to grieve in the cause of the year and we had times of laughter. Through it all, God has been our Rock and our Salvation, our Sustainer our Refuge, our Fortress, our Shield and our Armour, our Buckler in whom we trust. It is of the Lord’s mercies that we have not been consumed for His compassion fails not. They are new everyday even for each day from January 1st till today in this great year.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				I am aware that some people are lying on their hospital beds today as billions of people all over the globe are warming up to cheer into another new year. In some parts of the world, the New Year will arrive twelve hours before it will dawn in another part of the world. That is the work of the Lord – His marvel, one of those things that prove God in nature. He created the world and set the boundary of each nation. He orders the appearance of the moon and the sun. He created the seasons for different purposes. The times of each of us are in His hands. Verily, He has done all things as He pleases (Psalm 115:3).
<br /><br />
As we rejoice in waiting to enter into another new year, we should remember to pray for those who are in pains now. Let us in the spirit of high expectancy believe and trust God for them that the dawn of the New Year shall bring forth their change of story. Let us remember to ask God to do new things in their lives and to give them joy instead of sorrow and strength for their weakness. Let us pray that we shall all experience a change for the best as the New Year is being celebrated. And let us believe in God that it shall be our best year on the earth so far.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Finally, let us prepare to start a new journey with the Saviour of our soul-Jesus Christ. Don’t begin the New Year without Jesus. No one can afford to go alone in the journey of 2018. We should not take certainty for uncertainty. It is only when we are in Christ and Christ is in us that all shall be well. If you are yet to give your life to Christ you can do so right now and enter into the new year as a new creature in Christ. We must make our ways right with God as we celebrate the end of a great year. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
