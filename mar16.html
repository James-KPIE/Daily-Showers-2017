And blessed be the most high God, 
which hath delivered thine enemies 
into thy hand. And he gave 
him tithes of all.</code></pre>

				The twenty–first covenant credential of Abraham was that he was a tither. Let me note very quickly that the covenant credentials we have considered are not listed in any particular order. Otherwise, tithing would have come very early because of its importance in our spiritual walk with God. Tithe is very fundamental in our spiritual and financial journey as believers.
As I have maintained, I believe that tithing is an acknowledgement of God as our Source. And by the little understanding that I have posited, the recognition of God as our Source is the first principle of supernatural prosperity.<br /><br />
Payment of tithe is much more than a financial transaction. It is actually a spiritual transaction in that Jesus Christ has become our High Priest in the order of Melchizedek to whom Abraham paid his tithe (see Psalm 110:4). So, when we pay the tithe, we are acknowledging God as our Source and exercising a spiritual privilege of stretching our hands unto Jesus our Lord and King who reigns forever, to place something in His hands. Only the deep believer may acknowledge this, but that is the Biblical revelation of tithing.<br /><br />
God did not inspire Abraham to pay the tithe for nothing. You will discover that Abraham was never sick. The devourers could not hinder his wealth from growing and his investments enjoyed supernatural covering against the emptiers and harvest hunters. He was very secure everywhere he went and whatever he laid his hands upon prospered. Abraham enjoyed all the benefits of tithing in accordance with Malachi 3:10-11. Whoever keeps acknowledging God for every provision through the payment of the tithe will never lack new opportunities. That is why we need to do it conscientiously and consistently.<br /><br />
Tithe is not an Old Testament thing. Jesus approved it in Matthew 23:23 as a practice that we should not throw away. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
