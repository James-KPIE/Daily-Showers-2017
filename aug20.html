            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: John 20:19-23 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Matt. 10:1</strong> <br>                         
And when he had
called unto him his
twelve disciples, he
gave them power
against unclean
spirits, to cast them
out, and to heal
all manner of
sickness and all
manner of disease.</code></pre>

				<p>
				Our Lord Jesus Christ had no qualms about the release of power to His disciples. To Him, it was no issue at all. And that is understandable from His style of leadership which was counter-cultural. During the time of His earthly ministry and until now, in many communities around the world, power is concentrated in the hands of a few, particularly political and economic power. Even now, some Christian leaders believe that they are the only ones who have exclusive access to God’s power. However, that is not the
principle of our Lord Jesus Christ as regards power distribution. Our Lord Jesus Christ gave power to all His disciples to go and do the work of the kingdom and to bring glory to the Father. Our Lord Jesus Christ taught us that no leader is designed to enjoy the exclusive usage of God’s power.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The expectations of our Lord Jesus Christ would be the reason for His attitude to the release of power. For example in John 14:12, He gave the disciples the mandate to do greater exploits than He did. Of course that mandate extends to us too. He knew that without the power of the Holy Spirit, it would be impossible to meet up the standard He commanded, so He released His power. A good leader holds power but a great leader releases power. Jesus Christ’s empowerment philosophy was to empower His subordinate so that they would all be able to do the work. He was never ambitious to be a superstar among the disciples. Rather, He wanted all of them to be shooting stars. When Peter asked for power to walk on the sea as Jesus did, our Lord gave him the power. He did not ask Peter whether he had fasted for forty days and forty nights as He did before He got empowered by the Holy Ghost according to Luke 4:1, 14. In the same manner, Jesus Christ did not allow any of the disciples to lord it over the rest, according to Mark 10:42-45.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Jesus Christ warned the disciples and all of us not to be power-drunk. He warned us not to feel superior to those who are serving with us. We are to share power with other people rather than arrogate it to ourselves alone as the leaders. Power-sharing is the spirit of great leadership as Jesus Christ our Lord taught us. He warned us to give freely the administration of the power to accomplish kingdom purpose because we also have received freely. There is no better way to enjoy ease in ministry than to share power with other people. Rejoice in the Lord.
