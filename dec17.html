            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: 2 Tim. 2:2</strong> <br>                         
And the things that thou
hast heard of me among
many witnesses, the
same commit thou to f
aithful men, who shall be
able to teach others also.</code></pre>

				Kingdom addiction requires that we do all in our power to raise people who will lift up the banner of Jesus in succeeding generations just as some people have invested their lives in us for the sake of Christ. I expressed this view some days ago that as believers we have spiritual fathers and mothers who we never know because they were the intercessors from other parts of this world who labored for the salvation of
souls until they died. God has saved many souls through those unreported cases of importunity. As we grow up in the work of the kingdom what we find is that we have people we are praying for per time and people in whom we are investing our lives too.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Kingdom mentoring can be initiated directly or it may occur indirectly. God brought Joshua along Moses’ way and Moses was a great mentor to Joshua. In Deuteronomy 34:9, Moses laid hands on Joshua and imparted him with the spirit of wisdom which he needed to succeed him in leading the easily-rebellious children of Israel. In 2 Kings 2:1-15, Elisha who had served under Elijah in a most humble way got the double portion of the power which his mentor carried before Elijah took off in the flight to heaven. Paul also ensured that Timothy was empowered for the ministry before he left him. On the other side we find vessels of God who have gone to be with the Lord and their works still mentor us. As we get their materials and learn from the deposit of God in their lives and ministries, we are mentored by them posthumously as it were. We can deliberately choose people to mentor us especially people of God who we see as role models and who carry the grace that we admire and covet. This is the only area where it does not amount to covetousness to seek what others have. I have two great men of God in Africa as my mentors who are still making waves for Jesus Church today beyond the continent of Africa. Each of them travelled to far away United States at different times to be with the late Kenneth Hagin so as to tap from the grace the sage carried. Sometimes you need to be desperate to make physical contact with a mentor but it is not an absolute requirement.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				It is wisdom to seek to know from one who knows better than us who has what we desire but which is not within our reach yet. I read somewhere that everyone who has seen far has laid his hands upon the shoulders of some other person to do so. Life is a school of learning and grace is a teacher from whose class you never graduate. If you are already mentored, don’t die with all that you have as great deposits in you. Blessings multiply with use. Get someone to mentor and pass the touch of kingdom righteousness and addiction to the next generation. That way, you will be of great value to the kingdom long after your life on earth would have expired. Rejoice in the Lord.
