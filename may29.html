				<p>
				The third category of people on the spiritual plane are those that we can refer to as <b>walking.</b> We know that before a child walks he would be up–standing. Standing is a precondition
to walking but it is possible for both to happen almost simultaneously. Walking Christians are those who have taken their stand and have no questions about their conviction in Christ. They have put off the old self and they are warming up to the glory of a victorious life in Christ. The walking level is that in which a believer has started a personal relationship with Christ and seeks to know Jesus more and more. Within a short time, given an unquenchable hunger for truth and a strong desire to continue to explore the life in Christ, the walking Christian will metamorphose into the running stage where the Christian will begin to do exploits as a soldier of Christ.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The running Christian has accepted responsibility for his spiritual growth by committing himself to a life of prayer and daily reading of the word. He is also committed to the sharing of his faith with unbelievers who have not known Christ. No Christian is qualified to be called a running Christian who is not an evangelist. The foremost characteristic of an Evangelist is the commitment to saving the lost wherever he finds himself. Coupled with this is the readiness to lay one’s lie down for the faith which we have professed in Christ. As at the time of writing this piece, I had just read of the havoc which ISIS did to the Christians in Syria. They had kidnapped over a hundred of them and beheaded twenty one of those who refused to deny their faith in Christ. That is how tough and demanding the faith that we profess can be. We should make us our minds to die rather than deny Jesus. Our Lord Jesus told us not to fear those who can kill the body but not the soul. And we should think and talk about issues like this constantly so as to reinforce our faith and prepare for whatever the end time agenda is offloading.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We must take our stand and remain standing by faith. We should expect the best and prepare for the worst. We should not fear death but we should deepen the fear of God in us even as the last days are here with us. Keep standing, keep walking and keep running. You will not miss heaven. Amen. Rejoice in the Lord.
