            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Gen. 2:21-24 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Gen. 2:24</strong> <br>                         
Therefore shall a man
leave his father and his
mother, and shall
cleave unto his wife: and
they shall be one flesh.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				We shall spend one more day to consider the onerous responsibility of the man in his home as the husband, the father, the priest and the prophet. To be the head is not an easy thing, particularly when you want to be a responsible ‘head’ and earn the commendation of God
who has put you in that office, and obtain the appreciation of both your wife and your children for being to them a blessed husband and father. I have been privileged of God to occupy that office for thirty-one years now and I know what it is to be a responsible husband and a father. However, blessed be the Almighty God who has been our sufficiency. A man who is not mentally prepared for marriage may easily quit when he faces the real responsibilities of marriage as some men have done all around the world. However, whenever God gives a man responsibility, He supplies the enabling grace. The husband is the chief thinker and planner for the home.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Our emphasis today will be on the need for the husband to love his wife. I believe that the duty of the husband to love is greater than that of the wife which is to submit. It sounds justified when we consider the circumstances leading to marriage according to the Biblical pattern. It is the wife that leaves her home, her culture, her people and those she’s had been used to since her youth and enters into a new place and possibly a new culture and into the midst of new people who may have totally different expectations of the young woman as compared to her own background. In those circumstances the woman really needs the ‘protective’ love of the husband. In some cases, some husbands are weak in this area as they expose their wives to insults and assaults and all kinds of embarrassment. In some cases some wives are not better than slaves in their husbands’ homes, so they just endure marriage rather than enjoy it.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Moreover, as it is in many cultures the wife changes her surname and now bears the husband’s name and all the glory she may earn for the rest of her life is identified with the husband’s family. There are cases where it is the fame of the wives that brought the names of the families of the husband to the limelight, like prophetess Deborah in the Bible. The name of Lapidoth would probably not have been heard of if not for Deborah (Judges 4:4). Let men think on these things and love their wives and God will bless them more and more. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
