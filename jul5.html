Ye ask, and receive not, 
because ye ask amiss, that

				God may be silent when our desire runs contrary to His purpose for our lives. Whenever we embark on a purpose that does not meet divine approval, it means our will and God’s will are in conflict. No prayer can make us enjoy divine approval for such and God may remain silent. Many people come to the altar
of prayer without attending to the state of their heart according to Psalm 15:1-5. God’s standard for those who appear in His presence is that they must come with clean hands and a pure heart. Proverbs 15:8 also tells us that the prayer (sacrifices) of a sinner is an abomination before God. Psalm 66:18 speaks in the same fashion when the psalmist applied the standard of God to himself. He said that if he regarded sin in his heart, the Lord would not hear him. We cannot deceive God. He knows the intent of our heart and judges our motives. That is why He looks at our heart while men look at our faces. (1 Samuel 16:7).
				</p>
				
				<p>
				How much of our petitions fall within the perimeter of God’s will? Some people even embark on unholy missions and they have the temerity to ask God to bless their effort! How do you explain the case of a man who stole government money to build a house and invites the pastor to preside over and pray for the laying of the foundation? God will show mercy to some of us, pastors. A politician who won an election through malpractices which are known to the public would still have a pastor bless him at his inauguration into a political office. What of his thanksgiving service for winning such an election? Pastors preside over such a service with pomp and pageantry. We approve what God disapproves and partake of other peoples’ sins. May God have mercy.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				When we move away from the track of divine will, God may keep silent. King Saul was installed into the royal office as the will of God and God was with him until he derailed. Thereafter, God became silent and would not be with him nor speak with him. We can confidently approach the throne of grace with boldness according to Hebrews 4:16 if we maintain holy hands and a pure heart before the Lord. It is in our own interest to dwell in righteousness before the Lord, for then, we are sure that our will shall not run contrary to His will. Rejoice in the Lord.
