Hear us, my lord:

				<p>
					We have seen the foundation of the Abrahamic covenant of blessing. The blessing is an impartation from the Most High which, if well–guarded, can affect generations yet unborn. God ensured the transference both in Genesis 17:7 and in Genesis 22:17. The anointing is such a unique, spiritual and intangible impartation that only God understands how it flows. Nevertheless, it is very real. It can break any barrier and it can abide wherever the Lord purposes it to. You will recall how
the anointing stayed with the bones of Elisha in the grave. I have jokingly said that Elisha’s anointing followed him into his grave because there was no one to transfer it to as Elijah did to him and as Moses did to Joshua in Deuteronomy 34:9.</p>
<p>The blessings of Abraham which were the overflow from the blessing include uncommon influence. As soon as Abraham responded to God in total obedience, God made him a man of great influence. Abraham had tremendous positive influence and impact on his immediate and surrounding communities. When he went to the people of Hebron to ask for a piece of land to bury his wife, they all acknowledged Abraham as a stranger who had become very popular and influential in their midst. They were short of words to express their honour and respect for a legend who had been a blessing wherever he went and they simply told him: “Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us.” Abraham was a spiritual, economic and political heavyweight in the land where he sojourned as a stranger. From tomorrow, we shall consider how the same blessing made the Jews (Abraham’s descendants) people of such uncommon influence all over the world. They just stood out in agricultural, engineering, in education, in information technology, in high-tech aeronautical security engineering, in bio–technology and so on.</p>
<p>Are you challenged by the uncommon influence of Abraham and the Jews? Are you just living unto yourself or you are minded to live beyond yourself? In your immediate community are you a lone ranger or a person of positive influence? If you die today will anyone miss you? If you are born again you have what it takes to be of uncommon influence like Abraham. Trigger it now. Rejoice in the Lord.
