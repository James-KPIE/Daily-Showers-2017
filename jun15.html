            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Isaiah 9:6-7 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Daniel 6:27</strong> <br>                         
He delivereth and
rescueth, and he
worketh signs and
wonders in heaven
and in earth, who
hath delivered Daniel
from the power of the
lions.</code></pre>

				<p>
				A miracle occurs when God supernaturally intervenes in the natural affairs or situations to reverse a natural situation or cause the uncommon to happen. The memory verse for today confirms that God is forever in the business of working miracles. He does signs and wonders, not that He did signs and wonders. Miracles are happening all around us. From the disappearance of kidney stones
to the supernatural supply of new kidneys and the stories of miraculous healings and a couple having their first child at the age of 60 and 59 years respectively – God can do anything, for with Him all things are possible. Miracles are normal with our supernatural God in the lives of those who belong to His kingdom.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				God rules in the affairs of men and at His discretion, in the exercise of His sovereignty, He can reverse any situation and take all the glory for it. He had provided for the needs of many people supernaturally just as He did for Elijah and the widow of Zarephat. The last meal of the widow became the seed for supernatural supplies during the famine both for that widow’s family and Elijah. The prophet was used by God to instigate the woman to take a step of faith whereas the little that was left in the woman’s house as her last meal provided a platform for the prophet to prove God’s power for supernatural increase.
				<br /><br />
				God’s power for miracles is constant. Jesus Christ is called Wonderful because He came to the world as a Wonder of God and He continued in the kingdom business of doing wonders all through His physical presence on earth, and till today. He is the same yesterday, the same today and the same forever. However, we have a part to play by provoking the miraculous. Our faith must come on line and be active. Jesus Christ acknowledged the role of the faith of many of the people who received healing from Him. He ascribed their healing to their faith in the power of God which He carried. He would tell a healed person that his or her faith had made her whole. All things are possible to the person who can believe in Jesus Christ. In Mark 9:3, Jesus Christ said: <blockquote>“All things are possible for him who believes.”</blockquote>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Are you believing God for the miraculous today? Hold onto God. Don’t quit or give up your faith. We must not give up on God because He is not limited by a man’s age or by any of our circumstances. In Psalm 115:3, the scripture says He is in the heavens and does as He pleases. May it please Him to make your miracle the next. Amen. Rejoice in the Lord.
