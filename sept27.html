Fear thou not; for I am

for I am thy God: I will

thee with the right hand 
of my righteousness.</code></pre>

				Helplessness can bring hopelessness on a person. There are people who find themselves in situations where they suffer delay because they could do nothing about it and no help was in sight for them. Just like the paralytic man by the pool of Bethesda, I have heard of people who could not attain their academic aspiration because, at a particular time, no one was available to help in paying their school fees or examination fees when same was due. Those of us who never experienced such challenges must be eternally grateful to God. Many
people who are more brilliant than we are have had their education curtailed or their academic advancement delayed. Millions of people especially in the poor countries of the world have died from sicknesses or suffered for a long time before their healing could come due to lack of funds to get medical attention and medication.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The man by the pool of Bethesda has been judged by many of us as being unable to give the right answer to our Lord’s question when He asked whether the man wanted to be made whole. Upon further reflection, one can understand that man’s predicament. He had watched helplessly for thirty eighty years as his hopes were dashed each time the angel came to stir the waters. His mind had pondered over this issue time and again and the problem had dominated his mentality. So the only answer that was readily on his lips was why he had missed his healing and Jesus Christ understood. Our Lord Jesus is very compassionate. That day was the set day when grace located the man in his very location and his healing could no longer be delayed. When God decides to favour a person, He uses the kind of anointing which I have termed overriding anointing to work out the person’s miracle. That anointing disregards lack of faith and other obstacles that may hinder the miracle. May the Lord solve your problem by His overriding anointing in Jesus name. Amen.
				</p>
				
				<p>
Does it appear you are helpless in that situation today? Please don’t hang up your faith. Psalm 46:1 tells us that our God is the ever present help in times of need. God can solve our problem however He chooses to. Don’t let the lack of monetary help make you hopeless. Prayer is an earthly licence for heavenly intervention. So if we refuse to pray, we are shutting the heaven. We can do nothing without God and God would do nothing without man. So, we must keep knocking at the door post of the Almighty God until He answers to our call. May God disregard the age of your problem and answer your prayer today. Rejoice in the Lord.
