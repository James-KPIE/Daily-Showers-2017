				Abraham’s number twelve covenant credential was trust. Abraham trusted in God and made God his Source. We have drawn the conclusion in this manual that David’s submission in
Psalm 23:1 can be explained thus: “The Lord is my source, I shall not lack resources.” To trust in God is a honour and privilege. As simple as it sounds, many people, even some
professing Christians, find it difficult to trust God. They are not sure that God would do what He has said He would do. God is patient with His children and would encourage them to grow their trust in Him.<br /><br />
Obedience to God’s instructions is a product of trust in God. Those who are fully persuaded that God keeps His words are quick to obey Him. Obedience helps us to prove God and it is so sweet to trust in Jesus because the more you trust Him the more He reveals His power and His love to you. Only those who trust God can prove Him.<br /><br />
If you are still building your trust in Jesus, go on with it because you are on the right track. Both Abraham and his wife laughed at God’s promise to give them the miracle child and God knew. So, He gave Abraham the assurance over and over again. Just as He promised to be Abraham’s reward in Genesis 15:1, God declared His omnipotence unto Abraham again in Genesis 17:1. He told him “I am the Almighty God.” He was saying to Abraham that there is nothing impossible with Him. God helped Abraham to grow his trust in Him until Abraham became fully persuaded. It was at that point that Abraham no longer doubted. It was then that Abraham gained the patience to wait for God. It was then that he committed to offering praises to God rather than complains or grumbles. As Abraham’s trust in God grew, his faith became established. When you trust a person you will believe in him or her.<br /><br />
It is in our best interest to develop our trust in God. Those who trust in Him shall not be ashamed (Read Isaiah 50:17; Romans 9:33 and 10:11). Trust is our guarantee for triumph. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
