            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Col. 3:1-6 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Col. 3:2</strong> <br>                         
Set your affection on
things above, not on
things on the earth.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				The future of every person on earth depends on his or her focus. That is why the Bible tells us to look unto Jesus as the author and perfecter of our faith. Many Christians have focused on persons other than Jesus and
they have run into trouble when such men or women of God disappointed
them. Yes, we all need mentors and role models but our focus must be on Jesus. A friend told me some years ago when I was trying to find out some truth in our ministry that <blockquote>“Every man of God is still a man.”</blockquote> If you place your trust in any man however greatly anointed rather than trust only in God, you may have yourself to blame. We cannot trust any man as we would trust God-that is the point.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				As Christians, we must also focus on the heavenly matters-the kingdom and its righteousness, purity, sanctification, holy affection, sacrificial living, service in the kingdom, worship and other things that define the kingdom. Focus requires faith. That is why we must trust in God as we have already emphasized for our faith must be in Him. It is only God that can do for us what no man can do.
				<br /><br />
				It is necessary to focus on the things above because our focus influences our actions. If we focus on heaven we shall live holy and keep away from all common sins such as lying, exaggerating, jesting and other sins of the closet such as immorality and other impurities. The power of focus keeps us in check at all times. Focus will help us to maintain soberness and would help us to maintain self-control. It is when people lose focus that they go off track or turn off their course. It is said when a man goes off track, he may be trapped and when he goes of course he may be cursed. It is a matter of focus. Joseph was focused on the actualization of his dream as he focuses on God and he did not miss it.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Another way to sustain focus is to keep the ultimate glory in view. This is true both for the spiritual and in the secular. Many of us kept the glory of our academic success in view while we were in the school and that in turn kept us in check from engaging in common indulgences that could have hinder our academic success. It worked for me. Even on this heaven-bound journey, focus on the above will sustain our marriage as we refrain from the things that could hurt the marriage. Focus will keep us holy and that is the vehicle that carries us to heaven. Focus determines who you will become and where you will end up. Rejoice in the Lord.
