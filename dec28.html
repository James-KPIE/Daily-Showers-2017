            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Acts 4:5-12 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: John 14:6</strong> <br>                         
Jesus saith unto him, I
am the way, the truth,
and the life: no man
cometh unto the Father,
but by me.</code></pre>

				<p>
				The manufacturers of different computer gadgets develop a device whereby each user can have what is called a password through which the system may be opened to be operational. The password is so important that if the user forgets it, he cannot have access into it unless he goes through a procedure to secure a remedy. Modern technology
has also developed a code by which each of us can have access to our bank accounts by a personalized number called Personal Identification Number (PIN). Without this personally chosen number which is known only to the account holder, no other person can have access to it.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Just as both the password and the PIN are chosen at the discretion of the users and account holders, God has in His supremacy and sovereignty chosen that access to His kingdom is through Jesus Christ, the Saviour, the Son of His love whom He sent to the world to suffer and die for our sins that we may live. And no one can query His decision. Jesus Christ is the only way to the Father. He was not a founder of a religion. He was not a religious leader. He is the only One who told the world that He came from heaven, from the Father. Without knowing Him, no one can know the Father (John 8:19,21-30). He came to do the will of the Father and to obey Him (John 8:50-55). He is the way, the truth and the life. He is the way out of the troubles of this world so that when we have been through it all we will not sink into the world. He is the way to our future of eternal bliss with the Father. He is the truth that sets free from all falsehood and brings us into triumph and He is our life both here and in eternity if we abide in Him. Jesus Christ is our all-in-all. He is the person that we need for now and for eternity
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Jesus Christ holds the keys of Jesse. He can open doors and shut doors. That is why we need to relate with Him now. Are there doors of opportunity which the enemies have shut against you,, He can open them. When you are in Him, it becomes impossible for the enemy to lock you out of your blessing because He is the Door and no one can shut a door against the Door. He is the bright and morning Star and if you are in Him, you will walk in His marvelous light. Why not embrace Jesus in this season and know the peace you’ve never known before because He is the Prince of Peace. Rejoice in the Lord.
