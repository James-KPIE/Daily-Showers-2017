            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Pro. 23:7</strong> <br>                         
For as he thinketh in his 
heart, so is he: Eat 
and drink, saith he to 
thee; but his heart is 
not with thee.</code></pre>

				David’s mentality was positively influenced by his personal encounters with God in his journey of destiny. Each conquest the Lord gave him boosted his faith until he carried a permanent possibility mentality. And that is the winning mentality every child of God must aspire to operate with. The testimonies of God, the
Lord of hosts strengthened David’s faith and deepened his relationship with God. The fear of the adversary was totally expelled from the mind of David and time and again, he was prepared to take on any enemy that came on his path for a fight.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Adversity is meant to toughen our faith. <b>Only those who face their battles and fight until they win can share the testimonies of victory.</b> If you never tasted poverty and you simply inherited wealth from someone else, you cannot share the testimony of prosperity. In fact, many people broke through early life hardship like Walter Anderson, Ben Carson, Terry Giles to emerge as people of substance. They are the ones who have a story of transformation to tell. About twenty five years ago, I was driving my Volkswagen Beetle car around Lagos, Nigeria without an extra tyre because I could not buy one, not even an imported used tyre. It was that bad. I had what I call audacious faith by which I trusted God as I prayed for several months that I would not have a flat tyre. You know what, God answered that prayer. The testimony is this: one decade thereafter, my family could buy a car cash down. That is for me a testimony of transformation, financially and materially, through divine providence.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Just like David, my family had a paradigm shift. We schooled ourselves, our children inclusive, to believe God against all odds and we trained our inner eyes to see a better and brighter tomorrow. I believe, as I write, that there is no scarcity in heaven. I also believe that as long as I have a seed in my hand, I have a tomorrow. I have engaged in giving until I gave my poverty away. From the early days in my father’s large farm, we were trained not to expect any good unless we work for it. <b>My late mother would tell you to work hard like a slave so you would eat later like a king.</b> I am amazed today when I see people who want something for nothing, even in the church. We all need a shift in the way we think so as to align ourselves with divine purpose. That was the winning card for David. Tough times taught him to think as God would think. You should too. Rejoice in the Lord.
