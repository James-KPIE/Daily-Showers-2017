            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: 2 Cor. 8:1-9 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: 1 Sam. 2:8</strong> <br>                         
He raiseth up the poor
out of the dust, and
lifteth up the beggar from
the dunghill, to set them
among princes, and to
make them inherit the
throne of glory: for the
pillars of the earth are
the LORD'S, and he hath
set the world upon them.</code></pre>

				<p>
				Jesus Christ is the great provider. Before man was created in
Genesis 1, God ensured that all that man needed for sustenance was waiting for him. Food, water and a comfortable environment were waiting. God impacted the man with the creative ability to get wood for furniture from the trees and to process cooked food from raw farm produce. When the people of Israel left Egypt and began their journey through the wilderness, God ensured daily provision for them so that they would not die of hunger. According to Exodus 16:35, God fed the
people with manna until they got to the boundary of the Promised Land. We recall that when Hagar and Ishmael left the house of Abraham with very little provisions, God took over their welfare and made supplies for their sustenance such that the boy did not die famished. When the famine which Elijah pronounced upon Israel was tough in the land and Elijah himself felt it, God arranged for ravens to supply bread and meat to Elijah in the morning and in the evening until the brook where he drank water also dried up. From there God asked Elijah to relocate to the widow’s house at Zarephat. The little food the woman had was multiplied such that both Elijah and the woman’s family all fed daily till the famine ended.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				All over the scripture, God has demonstrated that His thought for the poor is not to die in poverty. However, for the greed of a few people around the world (about 10% of the world’s population) who are sitting on more than 90% of the wealth the Lord had endowed this world with, scarcity would not have been so rampant around the world. Added to that is the amount of the world’s human and material capital that is committed to the destruction of lives, properties and other infrastructure. Anytime there is a war anywhere, the fraction of the world’s wealth that goes into such a war is more than enough to take care of several millions of people all over the world. Many nations are ravaged today and millions of people are pauperized because of senseless and unnecessary wars. The poverty of our world is self-imposed by our world.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The mind of Jesus is the mind that thinks wealth for the poor. God is not responsible for the woes of the world but nations’ leaders through selfishness and greed have brought many people into poverty and penury as refugees all over the place. I wish that someday a leader like president Assad of Syria will offer to vacate office as a leader rather than see the shedding of blood of one citizen of his country. That attitude would have led to a negotiated peace deal that will move a nation forward. Let the poor pray, work and hope in God who desires that he shall be raised from the ashes of poverty. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
