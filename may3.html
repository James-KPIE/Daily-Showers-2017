            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Gen. 3:6</strong> <br>                         

For God doth know that 
in the day ye eat thereof, 
then your eyes shall be 
opened, and ye shall be 
as gods, knowing good and 
evil.</code></pre>

				<p>
				As harmless as food appears, we must be careful the way we handle it. Food should give nutrition to the human body but it can bring poison to our souls if we become careless with it. We recently took time to consider the power of one and we saw the power in “one meal.” We read from the story of Esau how food became his idol such that he preferred food to his birthright.
It may look far–fetched to us, but many people have compromised their lives and destinies through the careless eating of food. Many ladies will confirm that one casual invitation to lunch or dinner was all that they honoured and they lost the purity of their womanhood. One sister was so devastated when she told me her story. She had purposed in her mind not to be deflowered until she marries and she was doing well until she received an afternoon invitation by one guy who was eyeing her. She declined at first but gave in at the guy’s persistence. That was it. By the time she came to seek counsel, she was full of sorrow for disappointing herself and for disappointing the God she had promised to remain undefiled.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				How much does food matter to you? Can you deny yourself of food occasionally as an exercise for the mortification of the flesh? Every indulgence we cannot look away from has grown up to become an idol in our lives. That is what goes on to produce addiction in peoples’ lives. Most addictions started just as a kind of likeness for something. Then it grew to become a habitual consumption. Then it gripped the soul as a stronghold which must be <b>worshipped</b> by feeding its desire. Then you got addicted and, now, have an idol which you are serving without knowing
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The good news is that <b>every habit that was started can be stopped.</b> The best approach is to begin to consciously feed your mind on something else consistently. Feed your mind on God–glorifying issues: salvation of souls, help for the helpless, becoming more useful in the kingdom of God. Take up some assignments that will sway your thoughts in a holy direction and find a friend who can become your accountability partner to whom you can uncover your vulnerabilities. We should avoid idols that arise through our eating and drinking. We must not be prisoners to any fleshly desire. Rejoice in the Lord.
