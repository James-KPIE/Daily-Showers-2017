And Abraham drew near, 
and said, Wilt thou also 
destroy the righteous 
with the wicked?</code></pre>


			<div>
				The love of God in the heart of Abraham was his ninth covenant credential. Those who love God genuinely also love the hard work of God and would do all in their power to avert the destruction of what God had created for His pleasure. Abraham loved people because he loved God. The primary parameter to
measure our spiritual growth is whether we are loving God and people more and more. Service is not the first parameter, neither is faith. Without the love of God, works of faith will not command any reward for faith works by love (Galatians 5:6). Jesus Christ would check our heart for love before He looks at our hands for the proofs of faith. You can serve without loving God but you cannot love God without serving Him. In all cases, love is the primary thing. As we observed yesterday, the fear of God and the love of God are inter–connected. You cannot truly love God without His fear in your heart.<br /><br />
It was the love of God in Abraham that caused him to intercede so vigorously for Sodom and Gomorrah. Grace for intercession was his tenth credential I have checked the life of Abraham and found that he hardly sought after his own interest. He never prayed much for his personal needs or comfort. How many of us would spend the time Abraham spent with God to pray for other people? Many of us are selfish on the altar of prayers and pastors are to blame for this attitude. We lead people to focus on their problems and where they do not seem to have, we create imaginary ones for them. Many believers in Africa agree that an enemy is pursuing everybody per–time and so before you pray two prayers you must pray against the enemy, real or imaginary. We gather people in the churches not to worship God but to help them magnify their challenges. So the people come to show God how big their problems are rather than magnify God in authentic worship and show their problems how big their God is and thereby obtain their victory.<br /><br />
Unfortunately, those who make idols of their challenges stay longer in captivity. When you begin to seek solution for other people through intercession, you will find your own problems disappearing faster. Love is not selfish. Abraham was not hindered from seeking the good of other people because of his personal challenges. He loved God and loved men as well. We must follow Abraham’s example in love. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
