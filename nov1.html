            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: 1 Cor. 2:12-16 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M:V: 1 Cor. 2:16</strong> <br>                         
For who hath known the
mind of the Lord, that he
may instruct him? But
we have the mind of
Christ.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				We shall take time from today to consider the mind of Christ. The mind of Christ is central to how we fare in Christianity. It is the foundation for our attitudinal behaviour as believers and it is the determinant of how much of Christ we can ‘absorb’ in our quest to be
Christ-like in nature. True Christians have no existence apart from
Christ. That is why the first work of the Holy Spirit is to form Christ in us through the process of sanctification. To be sanctified is to wrestle against the flesh and win in the conflict by the help of the Holy Spirit so that the Spirit of God rather than the flesh (fallen nature) will begin to rule our lives. Until we conquer the flesh, sin will continue to have dominion over us. However, when we overcome the flesh, we become spiritual and the proof is that we can begin to discern spiritual things and our thirst for righteousness grows and we become more and more like Christ.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				In Romans 8:5-14, Paul the apostle wrote on the differences between the believer who is grounded in the Spirit and ordinary Christian who is not. The Christian who is still in the flesh is doing things from the perspective of a person who is not yet regenerated. Such a person is motivated by the pleasure and satisfaction of the flesh and he is selfish, always seeking personal comfort and he or she pursues the mundane things of this world. They are often blinded in the eyes of their mind and once any issue does not bring them immediate personal pleasure they are tuned off. You will never find such people in the intercessory ministry or in the evangelism team. <b>Christians who do not mind the purpose for which our Lord Jesus Christ died on the cross are dead spiritually.</b> On the other hand Christians who mind the heartbeat of God and have a feeling for the sinners who are heading for hell are alive spiritually.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				As we open up this subject, you need to sit yourself down and answer some serious questions. The purpose of the series we start today is to provoke Christians into the deeper truth about the righteousness for which we are apprehended in redemption. It is to inspire a holy dissatisfaction with casual Christianity. It is to spark off a revival as we enter into the last two months of this year. Are you truly spiritual or carnal? What do you ponder over most of the time- personal satisfaction or kingdom issues? <b>Those who have the mind of Christ are heavenly focused and they seek those things which are above.</b> You need the mind of Christ. Rejoice in the Lord.
