            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Isa. 45:19</strong> <br>                         
I have not spoken in
secret, in a dark place
of the earth: I said
not unto the seed of
Jacob, Seek ye me in
vain: I the LORD
speak righteousness,
I declare things
that are right.</code></pre>

				The rewards that await us for being co-workers with God in the soul-winning project are so great that they should compel every believer to rush into the harvest field and invest all that they have in the project. I was amazed when I read Isaiah 45:19 for the first time because I had heard some preachers preach that it is carnal to expect blessings from the Lord for serving Him. However, as I began to read the Bible and I came across scriptures like Deuteronomy 7:14-15, Deuteronomy 28:1-13, Leviticus 26:1-
10, Job 36:11 amongst other scriptures, I told myself that those preachers were liars or ignorant while God is true.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Obedience is the secret of abundance in the Bible. Faithfulness is the guarantee of fruitfulness. Proverbs 28:20 says a faithful man shall abound with blessings. What more do we need to hear from the Lord? There are preachers who do not take time to read the Bible and just because they have not tasted the blessings of God, they tell us that it is sinful to have what it takes to live a life that is above borrowing and begging. My definition of supernatural prosperity is living a debt-free life. For me, when that is achieved any other thing is a bonus. If you are serving God, I do not believe that you should beg or borrow to eat, to fix your accommodation or to buy clothes to wear. If that is so (and many of us passed through that stage) you must expose yourself to hard work and hard praying for your deliverance out of poverty. You can never open your mouth as a servant of God to say that it is the will of God that you remain a beggar. Three things will move you out of poverty into opulence – they are hard work, warfare prayers and sacrificial giving. There is no force on earth that can stop you if you are on that track and living in holiness with a heavenly mentality borne of possibility thinking.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				It is not carnal to expect rewards from the Master. Many believers in the category of those who consider it a thing of the flesh to expect blessings from serving God would be shocked to hear of Peter’s request from the Master in our scripture reading for today. The Master promises both earthly and eternal rewards. We must thankfully expect the rewards which Jesus has promised even though we do not serve Him basically for those rewards. It is a great privilege to serve in the first place. However, with God, rewards follow results. Rejoice in the Lord.
