            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: 1 Kgs. 18:33</strong> <br>                         
And he put the wood in order, 
and cut the bullock in pieces, 
and laid him on the wood, and 
said, Fill four barrels with 
water, and pour it on the 
burnt sacrifice, and 
on the wood.</code></pre>

				Whenever an altar of sacrifice is reared in Israel, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob would show up. Every time the altar is filled with sacrifice, fire came from heaven to consume it to show that God had accepted the burnt offering and that He had favourably responded to the sacrifice of His people. In Judges 6 when the angel of God appeared to the young man Gideon, he begged the angel to
allow him set up an altar of sacrifice and the angel gave him the go–ahead. Fire came and consumed the sacrifice and that was a proof to him that the Lord had visited him. Gideon was awed by the presence of the Lord which the fire symbolized and he called God Jehovah–Shalom (God of peace) because he saw the appearance of God and was not consumed.
<br /><br />
Just as the fire must be burning on the altar and it must not be quenched, there must be a sacrifice on God’s altar in our lives at all times. The number one sacrifice is ourselves. We place ourselves on the altar of sacrifice through consecration. That is the essence of Romans 12:1-2. When we surrender our lives to Jesus, that is our consecration to do the will of God whatever it may be. Without total and absolute consecration through sanctification (being set apart for God), it is very easy to backslide or turn back at the slightest appearance of challenge or temptation.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				As it has been written in this manual before, when your life becomes a seed (sacrifice) in the hands of the Lord, He becomes your harvest. God will become your satisfaction, your defence, your defender, your provider, your healer, your promoter, your shield, your armour, your buckler, your stronghold and your strong tower. <b>When you put everything in His hand you will see His hand in everything as far as your life is concerned.</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The Lord responds to the acceptable sacrifice of His people and He rises to their help whenever that occurs. In our Bible passage today, God responded to the sacrifice of Elijah. Every item of sacrifice on the altar was consumed by His fire. In 2 Samuel 24, God responded to the sacrifice of David and He stopped the plague that had killed seventy thousand people in just one day (v. 15). An empty altar may cause a delay in seeing the most desired manifestation in your life. As our lives remain a living sacrifice into the Lord, our hands must never stop bearing a seed of sacrifice unto the Lord’s altar from time to time. We must not appear before Him empty–handed. Rejoice in the Lord.
