And from thence to Philippi, 
which is the chief city of 
that part of Macedonia, and 
a colony: and we were in that 
city abiding certain days.</code></pre>

				All who are saved can be volunteers in the expansion project and we should be. Everyone who has received deliverance from the power of sin and satan would desire that other souls be saved too. The body of Christ is very rich with diverse gifts and ministries and the purpose why God made it so is that we should complement the efforts of one another. The whole world cannot be saved through one person. When
we synergize, we are able to do more than the result of our individual efforts added together (Ecclesiastes 4:9). Today, we shall consider how each of us can contribute our own quota to kingdom expansion on earth.
<br /><br />
The first way we can make our contribution is through prayers. Indeed, prayer is the basic tool to employ in breaking the bondage of sin in people’s lives. For those who have the grace to tarry for long in the theatre of prayer, they can stay among the groaners and intercede continually. Their prayers can break boundaries so we can take territories for soul–winning. The apostles gave priority to prayers and it sustained them in the times of persecution as they received boldness even as they were filled again, by the Holy Spirit.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The second way is to join the goers. These are evangelists who have been empowered by the Holy Spirit and they are able to share the gospel with sinners in a way to persuade them to surrender their lives to Christ and be saved from their sins. There are missionaries all over the world today who are seeking the salvation of souls even in very hostile communities. Many of those missionaries have lost their lives in the pursuit of this highest calling. We are consoled that they have received the “welcome home” greeting from our Lord Jesus Christ. These, notwithstanding, we must still go because souls are still perishing and heaven is waiting to rejoice over saved souls.
				</p>
				
				<p>	
The third way to be a part is to be among the givers. We can give our substance to support missionary works. In Luke 8:3 some of those women who were ministered to by our Lord Jesus became well and prospered and supported the ministry in return. Paul was full of commendations for the many brethren he referred to as helpers and supporters in the ministry. Each of us can be a part of this most glorious kingdom project. Make the choice today. Rejoice in the Lord.
