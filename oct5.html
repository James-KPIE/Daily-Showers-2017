            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Malachi 3:8-12 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Mal. 3:12</strong> <br>                         
And all nations shall call 
you blessed: for ye shall 
be a delightsome land, 
saith the LORD of hosts.</code></pre>

				<p>
				There are great blessings which follow those who practice tithing as a covenant obligation. Tithe is ten percent of our income which belongs to God. It is the first tax on the income of every believer. It is God’s part of what we receive because in verse 10, God says “Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house.
Only the owner of a thing can tell you to bring it as a matter of
command. For good measure tithe is an acknowledgment of God as your source. And the recognition of God as your source is the first law of supernatural prosperity. You may waste your seed and your giving may not bring much fruit if you don’t recognize God as your source. God says in Hebrews 11:6 that he who comes to Him must believe that He is and that He is the rewarder of those who diligently seek him. When you pay your tithe, you are saying to God that you believe that He is and He will respond to you by opening the door of ideas, opportunities and favour and such blessings that will make nations call you blessed.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				To default in tithing therefore may hinder your blessings. For example when a man lacks the idea of what to do, he will be tied down at the same spot. Favour attracts people as helpers who could add speed to your journey. If such helpers are cut off a man may also suffer delay. It was favour that made Esther to win the heart of the king at Shushan. It was favour that distinguished Joseph both in Potiphar’s house and in the prison and it was favour that landed him before Pharaoh. Yes, the gift of Joseph made way for him too. But it was favour that created the platform for Joseph to showcase the gift of God in his life. It takes favour for a prisoner to be a guest in the palace. There were many virgins in Israel but favour located Mary to be the mother of our Lord Jesus Christ.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Failure to pay tithe may lead to a delay in realizing profit from investment. Devourers are harvest destroyers. They could also hijack the harvest as the Midianites did to the Israelites in Judges 6. If the enemy keeps eating up the harvest or the vine brings forth the fruit that are cast prematurely, the harvest of the planter is not only delayed but it is denied. For crops that are harvested once in a year whenever something goes wrong this year that means there will be no harvest until another year. Be wise. Don’t allow your harvest to be delayed. Be faithful in tithing and let God keep devourers away from you. Rejoice in the Lord.
