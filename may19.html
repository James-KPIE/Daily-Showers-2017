            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Col. 3:16</strong> <br>                         

Let the word of Christ 
dwell in you richly in 
all wisdom; teaching and 
admonishing one another 
in psalms and hymns and 
spiritual songs, singing 
with grace in your hearts 
to the Lord</code></pre>

				<p>
				Hymns are not for the past generations. Like the Word of God which never expires because it is spirit, hymns which were written by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit remain impactful and they are veritable tools for revival. Hymns help us to connect to Jesus. Many years ago, I heard the hymn ‘What a friend we have in Jesus.’ It showed me in practical terms, the great benefits of prayers and it taught me how not to keep carrying my burdens when Jesus Christ is my burden bearer. The hymn ‘Heaven came
down’ makes me break down emotionally each time I join the church to render it because it takes me back to my very beginning in Christ. The hymns composed by Fanny Crosby never cease to inspire genuine believers. She was a blind American hymn writer and poetess who wrote over 8000 hymns.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Hymns are good because they can help us reconnect to God. Through hymns which we render during worship, we can be spiritually revived. Consider hymns like ‘I am thine O Lord; Draw me nearer; Pass me not, O gentle Savoiur; Blessed Assurance; and Close to Thee; all composed by Fanny Crosby. In this age when our souls are bombarded with all kinds of noise and disturbing news on daily basis, we can find peace and serenity for our souls in those inspiring hymns.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Hymns also have the power to transmit anointing unto us just as the messages from the Word of God. You can receive impartation from the Word which was preached several hundreds of years ago even after the preacher is no more. That is the power of the Holy Spirit in action. You will recall that even the bones of Elisha still carried the power of God long after he was dead and buried. Holy Ghost–inspired hymns have the same spiritual quality. Hymns are not old school. They are relevant for all ages. When your spirit needs rest, you can find a quiet place and feed your soul with a good dose of hymns and you will find peace, joy and revival. Moreover, the end time is a period when we need to live by revelation. The world and its system will want us to live by the power of human mind and technology but neither of them will give us power to triumph over the satanic agenda for the end time. It is those who live by revelation that can overcome the wiles of the devil.
				
				<br /><br />
				
				Turn to the hymns again and you will find a way to deepen your worship. Modern Christian music is very good but hymns must not be thrown away. Rejoice in the Lord.
