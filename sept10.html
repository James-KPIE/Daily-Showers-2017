            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: 2 Kings 4:1-7 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Hos. 12:13</strong> <br>                         
And by a prophet the 
LORD brought Israel 
out of Egypt, and by 
a prophet was he 
preserved.</code></pre>

				<p>
				We shall study how God works out permanent solutions to peoples’ problems from today with specific reference to who and what God may use to bring these solutions. God uses His servants, that is, ministers of the gospel to bring solutions to problems through the enablement of grace and by the anointing of the Holy Spirit. Many
Christians have different gifts of the Holy Spirit and the gifts are given for the profiting of the church and even for people outside the church. Jesus Christ ministered healings to the demonic and leprous. Even people who were not from Israel, like Naaman, received healing through the grace of God that qualifies the unqualified. Pastors, evangelists, apostles and other anointed vessels of God are God’s anointed agents for bringing solutions to the challenges of men and women.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				In the Bible times especially in the Old Testament, prophets were the most popular servants of God. Although there were priests in the temple who ministered to the Lord, it was common for people to seek for prophets when they had challenges. The prophets were also called seers. For example, in 1 Samuel 9 when Saul’s father sent him to look for the lost donkeys and Saul searched for days without success, the young man who was with Saul suggested that they should look for a prophet who would tell them about their journey and possibly give them the solution. They went and met Prophet Samuel whom the Lord had prepared to announce to Saul that he would be the first King of Israel. Again, in 2 Kings 3 when the kings of Israel and Judah were going to fight the Moabites, the supplies for the army ran out in the wilderness as they were going around in circles for seven days. They sought for a prophet who could find solution to their problem and they found Elisha. In our Bible passage for today, the widow ran to the prophet (Elisha) to seek solution to the problem she had when her two sons were to be taken into slavery for the payment of their late father’s debt. And God used the prophet to solve the problem.
				</p>
				
				<p>	
Prophets are ministers of God who are also able to discern the mind of God on issues pertaining to people’s lives. It has been said that pastors bring people to God while prophets bring God to the people. Of course a pastor may also be gifted to operate in the office of the prophet. The prophet is used in this exhortation to represent the ministers of God who daily minister to people for their problem to be solved. You can seek the men and women of God for the solution to your problem. Rejoice in the Lord.
