And the child Samuel grew 
on, and was in favour 
both with the LORD, and 
also with men.</code></pre>

				One of the blessings of spiritual worship is that it can aid our spiritual growth as we observed in yesterday’s exhortation. Spiritual growth occurs when we mature in the things of the spirit. It is not a function of age or the number of years a person has spent in a church. One of the ways to find out whether we are growing in Christ is to ask ourselves whether we are doing
better today than we did some five years ago. For example, if your reaction to those who offended you five years ago was to fight back and then engage in malice and that attitude has remained with you till today, then you have not grown up spiritually. The more of God we know through worship and the study of God’s word, the more mature our relational attitudes must become.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				There are various stages of spiritual growth. Our focus today is on those who are at the stage we can call <b>stagnation.</b> Christians in this category are not challenged at all. They are satisfied with going to church as a matter of routine. They do not have time to study the Bible or attend House fellowship. The primary aim of coming to church for such people is to be identified with a church. Such fellows may not be financially committed too. Some people in this category may not have repented of their sin and they may continue to postpone any response to the altar call for salvation, yet they know they are unsaved. There are church people who do not see anything wrong with adultery or fornication. Yes, there are. The fear of God is yet to have a grip on the heart of a person who stagnates spiritually. their contributions to any debate on issues that pertain to the church are also carnal. They see things only from the worldly perspective.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The children of Eli were in this category. They were raw sinners who committed sins with impunity at the temple. The two boys were immoral and spiritually bankrupt. They polluted the temple of God and were very reckless. The boys grew up in age but they stagnated spiritually and brought shame to the ministry of their father, Eli. We must daily challenge ourselves to spiritual growth as we see our lives constantly in the Bible as it mirrors our conduct. This challenge is for all Christians. Rejoice in the Lord.
