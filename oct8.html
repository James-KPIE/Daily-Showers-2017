            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: 2 Corinthians 9:1-10 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: 2 Cor. 9:10</strong> <br>                         
Now he that ministereth seed 
to the sower both minister 
bread for your food, and 
multiply your seed sown, and 
increase the fruits of 
your righteousness</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				We have spoken about the seed once or twice in this edition and it is here again in another relevant area of our lives. Men are in sizes and life is in stages. Many years ago the Spirit of the Lord put a prayer point in my spirit that goes like this: <b>Lord, do not allow the blessing of the morning season of my life to tarry till the afternoon season; do not permit the blessings of the afternoon
season to tarry till the evening time and do not let the blessings of the evening season follow me to the grave.</b>
<br /><br />
Many peoples’ blessings do follow them to the grave in the sense that for one reason or the other such blessings were delayed and did not manifest until they die. We were in a most recent retreat of a large congregation of believers and the Spirit of the Lord spoke concerning brethren who had withheld their seed after they heard a clear instruction to release such a seed. Our God is faithful and righteous. In His faithfulness every blessing that is tied to a seed is released from heaven as the obedient child of God surrenders the seed. In His righteousness, if you withhold the seed, heaven also withholds the blessings which should follow the sowing of the seed. <b>In such situations heaven does not move until we make the move.</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We could imagine what would have happened if Abraham had withheld Isaac. He would have missed the sworn blessings of the Lord. By the benefit of hindsight, imagine that Abraham did not release the seed which he sowed when he fed the three strangers in Genesis 18:1-10. The time for the release of Isaac could probably have been delayed. But Abraham was very sensitive to divine signals and he recognized opportunity. He attended to his self–drawn guests with a sense of urgency. After these three men ate his food they spoke as one person to announce the release of the son of promise for a specific time. Until that time Isaac had only existed in prophecy.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Think over this matter. Do you have a seed which you have withheld from sowing? Go; sow the seed as soon as it is practicable for you because you might have delayed the release of a blessing from God. You must also wait continually on the Lord to see what He shall say to you. Do not miss great opportunities in the kingdom. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
