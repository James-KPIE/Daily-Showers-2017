            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Isaiah 53:1-5 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: 1 Pet. 2:24</strong> <br>                         
Who his own self bare
our sins in his own
body on the tree, that
we, being dead to sins,
should live unto
righteousness: by
whose stripes ye were
healed.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				The death of Jesus Christ on the cross was an atonement for our sin. All of us were born as sinners because we were tainted with the sin of Adam. Romans 3:23 says “all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. The sin in this verse does not refer only to the sin anyone is committing presently. That verse refers only to the nature of sin with which everyone is born. We can understand the verse better if we put it this way – all have sinned in Adam and fall short of the glory of God.
We were all in Adam when he sinned in the Garden of Eden. We are the seed of Adam. God never created any other person as He created Adam but we were the seed which God put in him (Adam). Every seed in Adam was corrupted by the sin of Adam. As Adam lost the original glory which he carried through sin, having been created in God’s image, so was the seed in him. That is why the first son of Adam was not born in God’s likeness (image) but he was born in the likeness of Adam (Genesis 5:3). The poor son was tainted with sin (as we all were) right from when he was conceived in the womb.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				And that explains why Jesus Christ could not come from the corrupted seed of man. Rather He was supernaturally conceived but He only used the womb of Mary as a passage. The seed which produced Jesus Christ is the word of God and the word of God is pure, that is why one of Jesus Christ’s names is the Word (John 1:1-2). Our Lord Jesus came as a sinless Saviour to save the sinful man. He went to the cross and He shed His blood to make atonement for sin. Healing came from this atonement for two reasons. One, sickness came through sin. There was no sickness (which is an agent of death) until the fall. Death was in existence before Adam but it was not active. Sin was required to activate death. So, death came into operation when Adam sinned and so were all the agents of death such as fear, sickness, hate, murder, envy and so on. So when Jesus Christ offered His life as atonement for sin, He broke the power of death and by extension the power of sickness. Two, it is evident from Isaiah 53:5 that Jesus Christ did the work of our salvation and healing simultaneously on the cross. That is how healing came through the atonement.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The result of this understanding (not mere knowledge) is supernatural empowerment. Knowledge provides information but understanding provides comprehension. You need the spiritual comprehension of what the atonement has done for you to enjoy the blessings that flow from the cross. That is where your victory lies over all the lies of Satan about your health. Arise and walk in the consciousness of healing and total health through the atonement. Rejoice in the Lord.
