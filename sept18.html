            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Exo. 14:21</strong> <br>                         
And Moses stretched out his 
hand over the sea; and the 
LORD caused the sea to go 
back by a strong east wind 
all that night, and made 
the sea dry land, and the 
waters were divided.</code></pre>

				If you are a believer, God wants you to believe that He can use anything He has created to bring a solution to your problem. We have referred to the story in the Bible passage for today earlier on this subject, to illustrate God’s power to work out a permanent solution to our problems. The harassment by the Egyptians and their hot pursuit behind the Israelites ended as they perished in the red sea. The best of permanent solutions to our challenges is the death of the enemy
who is the problem or who is behind the problem. God will grant you rest from every adversary in Jesus name. It must be added, however, that we cannot dictate to God to kill anyone. We can ask God to withdraw the backbone of the enemies or to render their weapons impotent or to send confusion into their midst or to cause them to fight against one another. God is the only One who can decide who to kill or to keep alive.

				</p>
				
				<p>
				Pharaoh and his soldiers went too far by pursuing the Israelites as far as the red sea. He and his people had urged the Israelites to leave Egypt in a hurry, following the killing of their first born sons on the Passover night. The Israelites all left overnight and they posed no danger to the Egyptians any longer. We recall that Pharaoh had complained that the Israelites were mightier than they and that was why they sent taskmasters and slave–drivers to make life difficult for them. Now, the people whom the Egyptians envied had left, yet they pursued them. The Israelites were not prepared for war on that journey. They had no weapons of war with which they could fight the Egyptians. That was why the Lord of hosts arose to fight for them.
				</p>
				
				<p>	
There was not much known about the east wind until the red sea encounter between God and the Egyptians. The Lord had dealt with the Egyptians by sending all manners of plagues to them. Now, it was an east wind that blew the sea apart, long enough for all the Egyptians to be right inside the middle of the parted sea after the Israelites had crossed unto safety on the other side. Then, the Lord released the waters and the stubborn pursuers were swallowed up. The Lord is great and mighty. He is mighty and powerful to use anything to accomplish His purpose. May you experience God in that dimension. Rejoice in the Lord.
