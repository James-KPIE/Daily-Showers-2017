            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Gen. 19:27</strong> <br>                         
And Abraham get up early 
in the morning to the place 
where he stood before the LORD:</code></pre>


			<div>
				Abraham was spiritual and he profited from spiritual sensitivity. We shall consider this factor as his sixteenth covenant credential. As a result of being spiritually sensitive, Abraham recognized opportunities as they came from heaven. Beloved, God passes instructions for our ultimate benefits on
daily basis, but many Christians are not sensitive to the Holy Spirit. One of the biggest assets of the believer is the ability to hear God when He speaks to his heart. All the accounts of personal conversations that people had with God in the Bible can be our experience also on daily basis. You will recall that when we considered Abraham as a man who was regular at the altar of worship, we concluded that the altar is a place of communing with God. It is not just a place of speaking to God but a place to hear Him speak to us as well.<br /><br />
Abraham’s sensitivity worked well in his favour because it was on the day he entertained those three strangers that the arrival date of Isaac was announced. Before that time, Isaac had only remained in prophecy. God kept giving assurances to Abraham but on the day that this old man made a feast for unknown strangers who turned out to be the triune God appearing in those three men, an end came to the long time waiting of Abraham for the promised covenant child.<br /><br />
Spirituality is the foundation for supernatural prosperity. Abraham prospered because he fulfilled divine instructions. Isaac prospered to the envy of the Philistines because he could hear the voice of God. Jacob had genuine conversation with God and ideas flowed into his heart from heaven. Joseph knew what to do in a different situation when he needed to rescue a national economy from famine because he was sensitive to the Holy Spirit. He got to the throne because of His connectivity with the divine. How spiritual are you? Are you seeking a closer walk with God or you are satisfied with artificial Christianity? Make your choice. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
