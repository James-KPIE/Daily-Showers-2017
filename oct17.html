            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Matt. 6:25</strong> <br>                         
Therefore I say unto you, 
Take no thought for your 
life, what ye shall eat, 
or what ye shall drink; 
nor yet for your body, 
what ye shall put on. Is 
not the life more than meat, 
and the body than raiment?</code></pre>

				To worry is to get anxious over a situation because you are unsure whether the outcome will turn out in your favour. Worry often comes when we shift our focus from God in addressing a matter of concern to us. People who worry usually leave out God in their calculations of what the end of a particular situation would be and that is where the problem of worry lies. Divine intervention is purely a matter of divine discretion. The timing of an intervening act of God cannot be predicted by any mortal man. When Meshac, Shadrach and
Abednego were to be thrown into the fiery furnace, anyone could have given up as the king’s soldiers moved them towards the fire. Friends would have turned back in grief at that point. If they were married, their wives would have concluded they have seen the last of them. But God did not deliver them from being thrown into the fiery furnace. He only went into the furnace to turn the heat into coldness and the fire did not hurt them, whereas those who brought them in were all killed by the flame of the fire.

				I cannot forget the agony of Ishmael’s mother, Hagar when they left the house of Abraham and commenced their journey in the wilderness. After some time the water in their water bottle was finished and the poor boy became thirsty unto death. So, the mother left him under a tree and went a little distance away so she would not see the boy when he gave up the ghost. But Hagar forgot the prophecy of God over that boy. If she had remembered she would not have worried. God had said that the boy shall become a nation. It was the boy’s covenant reward for coming out of the loins of Abraham, even though his generations would not be covenant carriers like those of Isaac. God suddenly provided a well in the desert from where succour came for the boy and he survived. Worry comes when we close our mind to what the Lord had said. You see, God Himself is bound by whatever He had said. Rather than worry in the time of trouble, it is more useful to call the promises of God to heart and begin to ‘chew’ it as it were. That is meditation. That is the time to also remind God of what He has said as we call Him in prayer. Prayer is bringing God’s promises back to Him for performance.
				</p>

				Worry never solves any problem. On the contrary, worry can constitute a mental blockade which will even prevent you from taking the right step. Worry may cause you to act in panic and cause more damage or worsen the situation. Philippians 4:6 tells us the solution to worry–pray with thanks to God for His faithfulness to intervene and He will give you peace in return. Rejoice in the Lord.
