            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Ezekiel 47:1-5 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Eze. 47:5</strong> <br>                         

Afterward he measured a thousand; 
and it was a river that I could 
not pass over: for the waters 
were risen, waters to swim in, 
a river that could not 
be passed over.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				We shall continue on the life at the cruising level today. Just as the aircraft in which we fly determines our cruising level, the current of the flood also determines our speed when we are carried by it. Both the wind (in cruising) and the flood (in swimming) are symbols of the Holy Spirit. By analogy we want to see how we are assisted in living the maximal life in the Lord as children who abide in Him by holy living. You see, God is
interested in our success, victory and sustained peace. That is why He teaches us to succeed according to Isaiah 48:17. He has also made us to be more than conquerors according to Romans 8:37. His peace has been given to us both as an inheritance and as a gift according to John 14:27. The table of comfort and an enviable and colourful life is set for us in Jesus Christ but we have to live by the rules.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The Holy Spirit is the Flood and the Wind. He is the River of water which flows in the believer and gives expression to an impactful and a fruitful life. We don’t bear our own fruits but the Holy Spirit in us causes us to bear fruits. The more the Holy Spirit possesses us the more fruits we bear. This is clear from John 15:1-7. If we really understand how much God the Holy Spirit wants to do in us and with us, we will not struggle with obedience to any divine instruction. Our Lord Jesus Christ told us in John 15:5 that without Him we can do nothing. The reverse is also absolutely true–with Him we can do anything, I mean, everything. That should not amaze us. From scriptures such as Ephesians 3:20, John 7:37-38, Acts 1:8; Mark 16:17; Luke 21:15 and Luke 10:19, God has expressed His will for our supernatural victory and exploits without any hesitation or reservation. In Daniel 11: 32, he told us no less.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The Holy Spirit is ready to carry us by the flood of His power, but we must enter into the river and deep ourselves inside it to be carried by the river. This, again, calls for yieldedness which we emphasized yesterday. Partial commitment to the things of the kingdom or seeking the kingdom only for what we shall profit will never take a Christian to the level in which he can be submerged in the Holy Spirit. Life is sweetest when we allow the Holy Spirit to lead and guide us, for this God is our God and forever He will be our guide even unto the end. Rejoice in the Lord.
