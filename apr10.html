					Every person can emerge as a man or a woman that will be remembered for making a difference in the community or in someone’s life. I know people that I have met in my life’s journey who have made such unforgettable impact in my life. One or two
people have also shared such a testimony in my favour. I hope this number increases. There is no sin or shame in making up your mind to be someone who will be a solution provider or a pathfinder or a pioneer in areas of life or science yet to be explored. Once and again, such people who made positive impact during their lifetime have their names written in the history book and posterity will never forget them. It has been said that those who live for others never die. Their selfless deeds are evergreen in peoples’ memory. Those who live selfishly unto themselves miss such privileges.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I am reminded of the former South African President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (July 18, 1918 to Dec., 5, 2013). He was not known for wealth acquisition like most African rulers. He spent the greater part of his life in fighting the evils of apartheid. He suffered for the course of the majority of the people of his dear country. He placed his life at risk in the pursuit of a higher cause above his personal interests. The world celebrated him at his departure from this earth in a way we have not seen any other African leader celebrated. He left an enviable record of selfless patriotism through an untiring spirit of doggedness in the pursuit of a worthy cause.
				</p>
				
				<p>
The story of the traveler who was attacked as he traveled from Jerusalem to Jericho shows us that impact is not necessarily a matter of title or position, even in the house of God. Both the priest and the Levite ignored the victim of armed bandits on the highway. What was on their mind? What other opportunities were they waiting for to show the love by which followers of Christ should be distinguished? We never know what impact a little gesture of liberality could bring. We are re-recreated in Christ to make a difference, to be a helper to someone who needs help and to be a good neighbour as Jesus Christ our Lord had said. You can be the one person who will make a great difference. Rejoice in the Lord.				</p>
