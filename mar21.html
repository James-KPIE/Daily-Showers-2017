Bring ye all the tithes into the 
storehouse, that there may be meat 
in mine house, and prove me now 
herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, 
if I will not open you the windows

				We have examined the power of one name–the name of Jesus. The greatest revelation I received in the course of considering the name of Jesus is that He did not come as a religious leader but indeed, whether anyone likes to hear it or not, Jesus is the Creator of all those religious leaders that have shown up on the surface of the earth. So, there is no comparism between them and Him.
Today, we shall consider the power of one blessing and it may take us to one or two more days. I wrote on the subject of one blessing in my book titled Manifestation terminates<br /><br />
molestation (2013). The Bible refers to this kind of blessing as the blessing in Psalm 24:5 which says that the man who is pure and holy before the Lord shall receive the blessing from the Lord. The blessing is a spiritual impartation that confers a supernatural advantage on a child of God. It does not refer to a physical or material benefit. On the contrary, the blessing facilitates or causes the material and physical blessings to be drawn towards the righteous. For example, in Psalm 1, the Bible says the righteous is blessed. That is a reference to the blessing. When you are born again and the Spirit of God enters into your life, you become a carrier of the blessing and the covenant of blessing becomes a manifestation–that whatsoever you do as the righteous shall prosper. If your life is not Bible–compliant, it cannot be blessing–commanding. There are no two–ways about it.<br /><br />
Many people have missed out on God by being an outsider to the covenant platform upon which the truly born again children of God operate. They are church goers but they have not surrendered their lives to Jesus Christ. They miss out on the vital expressions of the blessing such as divine partnership, divine favour, divine health and supernatural victory which are all part of our heritage in redemption. Until a man is born again, the blessing cannot rest upon him. The choice is yours. You can surrender your life to Jesus today and receive the impartation of the blessing. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
