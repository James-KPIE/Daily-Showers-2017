            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Deuteronomy 32:39-40 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Mal. 3:6</strong> <br>                         
For I am the LORD, I change 
not; therefore ye sons of 
Jacob are not consumed.</code></pre>

				<p>
				We understand the power of God to bring permanent solutions to problems and we have seen several examples where God brought solutions and in the process humbled the proud who boasted in their power. Among such examples are Sennacherib, Pharaoh, Herod and Haman. We shall examine the uniqueness of the manner in which God dealt with Goliath and Haman later.
				<br /><br />
				The first reason why God brings solutions is because, that is His nature. God is a problem–solver by nature. He has the answer to every question. He has the relief to every pressure and the solution to every problem. One of the common features that run through the Bible is that God provides solutions time after time. That is why God declared that He is the Almighty God in Genesis 17:1. The unlimited power of God is not meant for show, no. The mightiness of God is to bring solutions to those challenges that seem so mighty so that His mightiness will swallow up the mountains that confront us.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				God also brings solutions because He delights that we have life in abundance. God’s plan for us is a ‘plus’–life and not a life of minus. In John 10:10, Jesus Christ declared: “The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy; I am come that they might have life and have it more abundantly.” God never wants the work of His hand to be destroyed. Jesus Christ our Lord suffered, bled and died on the cross so that through His death we might have life. God does not want the life that the blood of His Son has redeemed to be wasted. We are precious to God because we were redeemed at a cost. God solves our problems so that we can enjoy the victory that Jesus Christ won for us through the cross.
				</p>
				
				<p>	
God solves problems because it brings Him glory. In Isaiah 60:21 the Bible says: <blockquote>“Then your people will all be righteous; they will possess the land forever. They are the shoot that the LORD planted, the works of His hands, so that I might be glorified.”</blockquote> In Isaiah 61:3 we also read about God’s redemptive plan for the remnant in Zion thus: “To appoint them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness, that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that He might be glorified.” I believe God has joy when we are victorious and joyful. That is why we must grow faith in God in seeking for solutions to our problems. Rejoice in the Lord.
