            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Mark 1:40-45 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Mark 1:41</strong> <br>                         
And Jesus, moved with
compassion, put forth
his hand, and touched
him, and saith unto
him, I will; be thou
clean.</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				Jesus’ mind is deeply compassionate. He is merciful. That is why He does not want the sinner to perish but to have eternal life. The compassionate heart of Jesus would not want Him to see the widow of Nain go through a lifetime of sorrow (Luke 7:11-17). His compassionate mind is flooded with grace. And that is why He would break the law of Moses to heal the woman who had infirmity on a Sabbath because she
was a daughter of Abraham. Today, we are considering the truth that Jesus heals because of His compassion. His compassion made Him to touch the leper contrary to the laws of Moses.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				It was the compassion that Jesus has for all of us who were born sinners that pushed Him to the cross to suffer and to die. Even before He did that, Jesus did not encounter one sick person whom He ignored. Not once. And unlike many of us who are preachers today, He ministered grace. He never asked whether a sick person was born again before He ministered healing to him or her. Even in cases where the root of the man’s sickness was sin, He healed first and told the man to sin no more. He came to open the gate to the dispensation of grace, so He did not place law above grace. That is why He healed some and after He healed them, they surrendered their lives because of the overwhelming grace that He administered and the healed ones ended up as evangelists. The mad-man of Gadara was such an example (Mark 5:1-20). So was the leper. You will recall that the Samaritan woman who had changed husbands as if she was changing dresses ended up as an evangelist too.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The love of God is redemptive. It is not judgmental. It is only those who reject His love by failing to believe in Christ the Son of His love and receive Him as their saviour that are judged. The Bible does not tell us that the woman caught in adultery did not commit the sin. However, Jesus gave every first timer in His presence the chance to repent. I wonder if there is any preacher who never sinned before his or her conversion. We all need the bowel of compassion to minister in the healing grace. It is not up to us to pass judgment on a woman who is waiting for the fruit of the womb that the cause of her trouble is her pre-conversion sin. That is offensive against the spirit of grace. Let us minister with Jesus’ kind of compassionate heart at all times and we shall see more healings. Rejoice in the Lord.
