            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Is. 30:21</strong> <br>                         
And thine ears shall hear 
a word behind thee, 
saying, This is the way, 
walk ye in it, when ye 
turn to the right hand, 
and when ye turn to 
the left.</code></pre>

				We cannot lay hold on the heritage that we cannot see. Some weeks ago, we examined how God related with His servants in showing them what was ahead of them so as to prepare them to possess a positive mentality in approaching the battles that were ahead of them. God told Moses in Exodus 7:1 “See, I have made you a god unto Pharaoh.” That would break the mentality of defeat because it drove fear away, permanently,
from the heart of Moses. We also saw how God positioned Joshua for victory in showing him that he would need to lead his soldiers to fight against the king of Bashan and to lead a praise procession around the walls of Jericho. <b>When a man knows his sure destination, he would not be upset by where he is on the journey.</b> That is what the clear vision from God does to a man who walks with God. God shows him the end from the beginning.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				God has never left man in the lurch, without guidance. The problem is either that we shun His instructions through which He would step in to help us when our obedience is complete, or we are much engrossed in things of the flesh that we can hardly pick spiritual signals. If David had been carried away by the flesh, he would have put on himself the heavy armour which Saul gave to him. That would have weighed him down when swiftness was what he required to have a successful go at the giant Goliath. God had empowered David to overcome Goliath. The testimonies of God in his earlier battles would be the booster of his faith. He would win the battle not by the size of his weapons of war. David knew that, so, he proceeded against Goliath with the assurance of divine support and he brought Goliath down.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Your attitude to the word of God would determine the future you can see. If you are a giver in obedience to God’s word, you should see a future of abundance as you continue to engage in cloud–loading by consistently sowing your seed. If you serve God continually as David and Paul did, you should see a future of victory over all the enemies of your life and see preservation from evil. Paul declared in 2 Timothy 4:18 that God would deliver him from every evil work, and would preserve him unto His heavenly kingdom.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Train your mind in the word of God to see far so you would capture what God has in mind for your future. <b>The picture of your future is in the scriptures.</b> Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
