					Blessed are the children of God who recognize that they are sent to their world to make a difference. Blessed are those who see with the eyes of good into negative situations. It is in this latter category that we find Joseph who went through such troubles in the hands of his brothers because he dared to share the dream of his
greatness with them. They saw the future glory of Joseph and did everything possible to abort it. The saving grace for Joseph was his closeness to God through his fear for God who showed him the picture of greatness in the first place. The brothers of Joseph made concerted efforts to see that his dreams never came to pass but the harder they tried, the closer Joseph was pushed to his glory.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					A vital lesson for everyone to learn from Joseph’s story is that our advancement in life may be hidden in the adversities we may have to endure. Joseph endured the hatred and cruelty of his brothers. He patiently went through the ordeal from the hands of the immoral wife of Portiphar which led to his imprisonment. To make a lasting impact often calls for such great sacrifices as we saw in Mandela yesterday. There are times when we may even face persecution for attempting to do what is beneficial. These are some of the things people go through that add up to what we call life’s experiences. However, we should not be moved or give up, just as Joseph did not give up. If Joseph had allowed his sad experiences to weigh him down emotionally, he would have lost the joy that the relationship with God brings and it is that joy that helped Joseph to manifest the gift(s) of the Holy Spirit (Isaiah 12:3) to minister to the butler and the cup bearer of king Pharaoh because their encounter with him became his gateway to the palace.
				</p>
				
				<p>
Joseph saw the greater good in all his afflictions just as he told his brothers. Of course his dream was fulfilled in practical details. In Genesis 50:18, his brothers all fell down before him saying: <blockquote><b>“Behold, we be thy servants.”</b></blockquote> Don’t forget that you are sent by God to where you are. Be the person to make the difference. See through the obstacles and stay on purpose. Rejoice in the Lord.
