				Faith takes risks. Infact, risk is a fundamental element in our faith adventure. You believe in whom you have not met or seen before. You release your seed from time to time when the Bible says you don’t know which one shall prosper–whether this or that! However, the risk of faith is an authentic risk because of the proven nature of our God–the ever dependable God who will not deny Himself. Glory be to God!<br /><br />
The risk factor in Abraham’s journey of faith is the thirteenth covenant credential in his portfolio. As we read from the Bible passage for today, Abraham put his life and those of his 318 trained second–generation servants at risk when they went to wage a war to rescue Lot and the people of his city whom the enemy nations have carried away as captives when they overran Sodom. Abraham took the risk because of his love for the people. Abraham had a compassionate heart which could not allow him to sit–by and watch other people suffer. Just like Job, Abraham was sold out to break oppressions and terminate the captivity of the captives.<br /><br />
Abraham was used to taking risks right from when he answered the call of God upon his life. For example, he took off to go on a journey to a destination which God had not made clear to him, according to Genesis 12:4. He departed as he was told. In Genesis 13:8-10, he took a big risk when he conceded the watered plain of Jordan to Lot for the grazing of the latter’s cattle. How would his own cattle survive? Abraham was fulfilling scripture in taking that risk. Romans 12:10 counsels us to prefer the other person in honour. That is a wise concession. The risk paid off for Abraham because God undertook for him. When God becomes your undertaker, He makes you an overtaker. There are no dry lands but only dry men. God caused Abraham’s cattle business to flourish but we don’t read much of Lot’s prosperity inspite of his chosen location.<br /><br />
Our destiny is safe in God’s hands. That is why we can take risks in the journey of faith. God is faithful. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
