            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Matt. 8:14-17 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Matt. 8:15</strong> <br>                         
And he touched her hand, 
and the fever left her: 
and she arose, and 
ministered unto them.</code></pre>

				<p>
				We have considered the mind of Jesus on healing and health and we have examined how He heals us. However, why does Jesus heal us? This shall be our focus today. Everywhere our Lord Jesus went, He healed the sick because He had a compassionate mind. He broke the
law of Sabbath to heal people. The man who was paralytic for thirty-eight years and another daughter of Abraham that was a paralytic for eighteen years were all healed on the Sabbath. He also violated the law of leprosy by touching the leper who came to worship Him. We have considered that healing comes by the power of His deity-being God and it is no surprise that whoever came to worship His majesty automatically qualified for a healing or whatever miracle such a one would need. Through worship we can draw down the omnipotence of God. Blessed be our Lord Jesus the compassionate healer.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				One of the reasons why Jesus heals us is because our infirmities bring Him no glory. Our pains can only bring sorrow to Jesus. He is not glorified by our sickness. That is why He heals so that we can be joyful. The second reason is that our sickness infracts from the abundant life which He came to give according to John 10:10. Sickness is a minus; wholeness is a plus – a plus to God’s kingdom. The third reason why Jesus heals us is that sickness prevents us from serving God and it is through service that we can fulfill our calling. As soon as Jesus healed Peter’s mother-in-law, she served Him. We cannot seek the kingdom in sickness because to seek the kingdom is to get committed to make the kingdom impact lives through our services. The fourth reason why Jesus would heal us as a compassionate healer is that our sickness wastes the atonement. We read about healing through the atonement a few days ago. The purpose of the atonement is the restoration of life to those who have been oppressed by the devil. If we remain in sickness then the suffering of Jesus on the cross is wasted.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				There is a fifth reason why Jesus Christ heals us. It is because we cannot offer praises to Him in sickness as we would when in health so as to bring glory to Him according to Psalm 50:23. Remember that we are created for His praise according to Isaiah 43:21.It is always on the mind of Jesus Christ the healer to heal us for these reasons and more. Rejoice in the Lord.
