and with bitter herbs

					We considered the power of ‘one meal’ before our Easter break and we saw how one meal can cost a person his destiny. The meal which Esau took was our example. On the other hand, we find one good meal in the Bible. I call it the meal of deliverance. It was the Passover meal which the LORD instructed the Israelites to
take under the leadership of Moses. It was one meal that distinguished all those who took it. The meal prepared them for the journey unto freedom. It was the first meal of liberty from the slavery of four hundred and thirty years. The Israelites who were used to the meal of garlic and cucumber in Egypt were to take a spiritual meal for the first time. It was a meal that bore testimony to their liberty.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The Passover meal was a meal for a new beginning: a new beginning of joy, a new beginning of wholeness , a new beginning of life and a new beginning of status. After that night meal, the God of Israel did the wonder of ushering the Israelites unto a new morning that terminated a prolonged night of sorrow-the sorrow and agony of bondage in the hands of the slave-drivers and task-masters. The Israelites were now free to work and eat from their labour, to build and inhabit their own homes. They were no longer to work for other people to eat or to build for other people to inhabit. It was a meal for the restoration of all the fundamental rights of the Israelites as a people on the earth.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The generational effects of the Passover meal must be emphasized. God inspired the Israelites to prepare the meal for that night and to continue the observance from generation to generation. The Jews had continued in this holy tradition and observance over the years. When our Lord Jesus came, He approved of it for its spiritual significance. On the night he was betrayed, He served the Passover meal. It was to make Himself available as the ultimate sacrifice for our sins. He became our Passover lamb – the One that took away the sins of the whole world. He told the disciples to continue to celebrate the Passover as a reminder of His death until His second coming. He told us that we have no life in us unless we eat His body and drink His blood (John 6:53). The bread in the communion or Passover meal represents His body, while the wine (fruit drink) represents His blood. The Holy Communion meal which we take today is, therefore, a meal of faith. We take it by faith so we can prove God again according to His own words.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					This holy meal has cured sicknesses and terminated afflictions, even barrenness in some cases. It is one meal, which we take to remind ourselves of the new life we have in Christ through His redeeming death. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
