But when he was strong, 
his heart was lifted up 
to his destruction: 
for he transgressed 
against the LORD his 
God, and went into the 
temple of the LORD to 
burn incense upon the 
altar of incense.</code></pre>

				We discussed <b>self–glory</b> yesterday. Arrogant and proud people are seekers of vainglory. We also saw how this malady has crept into the church. Today, there are cult–like associations or leagues into which even pastors aspire to belong so as to prove the level of their spiritual and social status and perhaps the extent of their wealthiness. I am told that such pastors wear special rings on a specific finger. I
am not sure whether it is talismanic. Whatever be the motive behind any ambition to belong to any elite club of ministers, the colour of vain glory is not absent. Your congregation may be the biggest around the world without you seeking any special recognition for it. Our Lord Jesus Christ never took a title although titles are attached to the respective offices and functions of ministry in the Bible. When we go beyond that, we are in trouble. I met a very serious brother who refused to be called a pastor because he felt he could not match the enormous responsibilities of the pastoral calling. Yet, he was fulfilling ministry.

				King Uzziah got to the throne as a teenager. God gave him a back–up that accelerated growth, development and trade in his kingdom. By special endowment there were witty inventions during his reign. Then pride came and he was overwhelmed by it. It is strange to imagine how satan could turn the heart of a man or woman who started from a very humble beginning and rose up through the help of God. When satan finishes with such a person, he will end up exalting himself against the very God who helped him in the first place. Have you not heard of a husband who tarried in prayer and fasting and moved from one prayer mountain to another in search of a job until the Lord answered him and he began to do well? Then one day, the same man put his two hands around his waist in the house and said to his wife “I know how much I labour in my sweat to get these things into this house.” Really? That is how vainglory begins.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Check through your countenance and disposition in the office, at home and even in the church. Are there traces of pride that result in vainglory? Rejoice in the Lord.
