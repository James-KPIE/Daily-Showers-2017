							<h1>KINGDOM COVENANT REWARD SYSTEM (PART 1)</h1>

							<!-- Text -->
								<section>
									<h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>							<h4 align="right">Sun. Feb. 5, 2017</h4>
									
									<h3 style=color:red>Daily Reading: Matthew 19:27-30 </h3>
									<pre><code> <b style=color:red>M.V: Malachi 3:18</b> <br />                         
Then shall ye return, 
and discern between the 
righteous and the wicked, 
between him that serveth 
God and him that 
serveth him not.</code></pre> 

									<p>
There is a reward system which God has instituted according to His word. We do well to understand how the mind of God works in rewarding the things we (kingdom citizens) do in His kingdom. The first issue is that the system is covenant-based. Only those who are in a covenant relationship with God have access to the rewards in
the kingdom. In the Old Testament, God related with His people based on His covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. In the New Testament, we have the covenant which has been facilitated by the blood of Jesus. Whoever believes in Jesus Christ and receives the washing of his sin by the blood of Jesus Christ becomes a covenant child to God and qualifies for the reward of eternal life. We shall concentrate on the reward for service in the kingdom, today.
									</p>
									<p>
As we shall see in the days ahead, the reward system requires our understanding of both information and revelation in different situations. As regards service, we understand from Exodus 23:25 that blessings are the reward for service. That is information. We need a revelation of how the reward can be obtained. The fact that something is available is not a guarantee that it can be obtained. That is why some of us find the words of our Lord Jesus in some parts of the gospel very fearful. He said in Matthew 25:31-46 that some of His followers will parade their service reports on the last day but He would disown and dismiss them, because they would fail on the count of love. It is possible to serve God without the motive of love. Any service that does not produce positive impact on people may not be rewarded.									</p>
									<p>
We also understand from Colossians 3:17 that service which is not done as unto the Lord will not be rewarded. We can serve in order to obtain personal gains; in order to please a person in authority; to obtain a name for oneself; or to qualify for a title in a church or to be promoted. God checks our motives according to 1 Samuel 16:7. In Revelation 21:12, God says He is coming quickly to give to each person according to the works of his hand. Our works shall be tested and it must pass the test of fire. My prayer is that our works in the vineyard of God will survive the test of fire. Let us watch how we serve so we do not miss the reward. Rejoice in the Lord.									</p>
