            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Lk.6:38</strong> <br>                         
Give, and it shall be 
given unto you; good 
measure, pressed down, 
and shaken together, 
and running over, shall
men give into your bosom. 
For with the same measure 
that ye mete withal it 
shall be measured to 
you again.</code></pre>

				Until much goes out of your little, your little will never become much. Those words got fastened to my heart since the day I heard it from my mentor. I have never needed to be reminded of it. Poor people get poor because they shut their mind to exercising their capacity to give. Giving is a culture, a habit to be cultivated. It is the same as saving money. If you do not imbibe the culture of savings when you earn a little, it becomes difficult when you earn big because the scripture cannot be broken. Proverbs 5:11 can be interpreted this way:
as wealth increases, so are the things that consume it. The natural tendency is that as you become wealthier, there are necessities of life that adjust upwards with you. They are always there to share what you earn. Find out what they are.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Those who wait until they have much before they give according to the injunction of the Bible may wait for a long time. We should learn from the widow of Zarephat. What if she held unto that last meal and refused to give it to Elijah to eat, what would have happened? In verse 13, Elijah told the woman to make a little cake for him first. That was a harsh demand from a woman who had only the last meal to eat and die, with her son. However, the law of sacrifice which is the gateway to abundance will not be suspended even for the widow because it is the way out of the crisis of scarcity.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				There are two kind of givers. The first group is those that I refer to as calculated givers. They always give based on the calculation of the negative effect that what they give will have on their comfort. They are more concerned with what is left in their hand than the amount they will give. That was not the posture of the widow of Zarephat. The second kind of givers are the addicted givers. Their primary concern is the kingdom need for the hour. That is where the widow of Zarephat belongs. This will be very hard to swallow for many Christians. To be able to give as an addict requires grace. It is beyond what our natural ability can do. Until you receive the grace for it, you cannot do it. When grace wants to bless you, it inspires you to do the uncommon so that grace can bring your way the unusual blessing. That is the secret. You can ask God for that grace. Rejoice in the Lord.
