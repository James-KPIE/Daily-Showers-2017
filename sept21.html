And she said unto her 
mistress, Would God my 
lord were with the prophet 
that is in Samaria! for 
he would recover him of 
his leprosy.</code></pre>

				People are possibilities. People are potentialities. People are opportunities. Whoever looks down on another person is not wise. It does not matter the social status, the financial state or the background of the person that is being looked down upon. The reason for this conclusion is that only God knows what each person carries in him or her as abilities, potentials or other endowments. That is also true of
connections. You never know how connected the person next to you is. Much more than that, you don’t know and cannot tell who or what that same person can become. And the most important reason why we must never look down on anyone is that each person is created by God and carries the God–given value of being a creature of God. So, if you won’t respect that fellow, please respect His Creator. If you do, you will surely give him the honour due to him as a fellow human being. In any case, to look down on anyone proves two things: ignorance and arrogance. <b>The best thing is to respect everyone, young or old, rich or poor, white or black.</b>
				</p>

				We have many stories about occurrences in the Bible which encourage us not to look down on anyone or write a person off. We find the example of the young maid, in the house of General Naaman, who was captured in one of the Syrian raids on Israel. That young girl knew the power of the great God of the Jews and she knew about the prophet in Israel too. As she watched her master suffer from leprosy she remembered her native country and the man of God there. So, she suggested to her mistress that her husband should go to that prophet for healing. Praise God, Naaman went and was healed under the ministry of Elisha the prophet.

Joseph was a common prisoner in the Egyptian prison. Nonetheless, in him were potentials which could bring the turnaround for the Egyptian economy and provide succour to the then world, as there was a global famine. Bless God; Pharaoh did not dismiss the suggestion by his servant when he told Pharaoh about Joseph and the exploit he did in the prison. The rest is history. All over the world, there are stories in like fashion–the poor becoming so much richer than those who had employed them, an ordinary person accomplishing great feat to the amazement of other people. Help may come from the least of the people you ever think of. Rejoice in the Lord.
