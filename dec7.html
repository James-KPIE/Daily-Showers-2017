            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Matt. 26:36-46 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Lk. 18:1</strong> <br>                         
And he spake a
parable unto them
to this end, that men
ought always to
pray, and not to
faint;</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				By violent prayer we mean intense, agonizing prayer. It is the kind of prayer that does not take no for an answer once you ascertain that your request is according to God’s will. The prayer of our Lord Jesus at Gethsemane was such a prayer. Although our Lord Jesus could see the agony and the excruciating pains that laid ahead of Him on the cross, He
prayed earnestly that the Father would spare Him but He submitted to the will of the Father. We cannot pray off a kingdom agenda but we can ask God for the enablement to go through whatever we need to pass through according to His will. We can learn that lesson from our Lord Jesus Christ. He was able to bear the cross through prayers.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Prayer, real prayer involves the whole of our being. Our physical bodies, our emotions and our spirit are all involved in the process of prayer. Prayer is a heavenly business transacted on earth. Indeed, according to Smith Wigglesworth who was often referred to as the Apostle of faith’, no one prays on earth. Indeed, a man who is absorbed in violent prayer is no longer ‘here’ as it were. At the height of agonizing prayers, you are lost from this world because you are practically sensitive only to those things from above. In the depth of soul-deep prayers, you can catch fresh revelations and see new visions. That is the realm where the deep calls to the deep. That is the place where a person can enjoy divine presence in its absolute reality. Men like George Whitefield, David Brainerd, and David Livingstone were all apostles of faith in the domain of prayers.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The immense power of prayer is the necessity for its absorbing nature. Prayer can change anything. Prayer can dethrone kings and remove presidents. Prayers can shut the heavens over a person, a business or a nation. On the other hand, prayer can set the captive free and cause a dry land to flourish. Prayer can make the barren fruitful and make the poor rich. Prayer can terminate a plague and cancel a curse. Prayer can unite the hands of an unwilling fellow and open the prison doors. In Acts 12, it was the prayer of the brethren that provoked heaven’s intervention by which an angel was sent to set Peter out of the prison. Whatever God can do prayer can get it done by instigating heaven for its manifestation. Prayer is a kingdom key. Use it and be a winner. Rejoice in the Lord.
