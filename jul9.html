            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: 1 Sam. 17:47</strong> <br>                         
And all this assembly 
shall know that the 
LORD saveth not with 
sword and spear: for 
the battle is the LORD'S, 
and he will give you 
into our hands.</code></pre>

				<p>
				Those who carry the presence of God into their battles through the peace they have with God are always sure to be victorious. The connection between peace and victory should not be underestimated. This is necessarily so because every battle is lost or won from inside us. In Psalm 78:9, the scriptures say that the children of Ephraim were armed as
sharp shooters with the bow, but they retreated in the day of battle. Why? It is because they were disconnected from God, having lost the peace of God when they broke covenant with the Most High. We find this answer in verse 10. The Almighty God is the Lord of host. His name is the Man of war. He has never lost a battle but when we lose our peace with Him we will not have the confidence to go and face the enemy. That may ultimately result in failure.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Compare the story of the children of Ephraim with that of David in verse 39 of our scripture reading for today. David had peace with God and, therefore, a supernatural confidence and boldness to face Goliath. In his own case, he removed the armour of King Saul because he was not used to bearing such weight in his earlier battles. God was his armour against the lion and against the bear. The arsenal of David for battles was filled with invisible weapons made by the hand of God and invisible weapons are more powerful than visible weapons. Doesn’t the Bible say that the weapons of our warfare are not carnal? Wise believers in Christ win their battles in the spirit realm before the enemy surfaces with physical weapons. We use the weapons of prayer and prophecy. We dislodge the band of conspirators by the power of prophecy. We turn our enemies against each other through prayers and we decree that their counsel shall come to nothing. If they remain stubborn, we invoke the law of divine substitution according to Proverbs 11:8. Only God knew how many souls perished for Israel to occupy the promised land. Now you know what to do.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				David went to face Goliath in the strength and power of the Lord. He won the battle by the power of the tongue (Luke 21:15). Power flowed for victory because he had peace with God. Rejoice in the Lord.
