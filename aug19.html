Insomuch that they
brought forth the sick
into the streets, and
laid them on beds
and couches, that at
the least the
shadow of Peter
passing by might
overshadow some of
them.</code></pre>

God will always release power to His servants who will genuinely prosecute the kingdom agenda of soul-winning on earth. Unfortunately, many Christians seek power for other purposes. Some of us want power so we can get even with an opponent or so as to deal with an offender in revenge or to show that we are superior to other people. In all these cases, God may not release power to us. We shall see how Jesus released power to the disciples tomorrow. We shall also consider the purposes for which He released the power.				</p>
				
				<p>
It is not a big deal for God to release power. Indeed, God is eager to release power for evangelism. And to see to it that ‘power for evangelism’ is effective for the release of captives and the breaking of all bondages and the healing of the sick, God empowered people like Stephen and Philip who were deacons in the early church. God did not reserve power for the ‘super’ apostles. John 1:12 tells us that the power of sonship is released to us as soon as we are born again. This power helps us to deal with internal forces that may want to keep us in bondage. We can cast them out by the power of sonship. Any spirit of oppression that wants to keep us enslaved to our past or any negative mentality that would inhibit our total commitment to the kingdom can be dealt with summarily by the power of sonship so we can be established and grounded in the kingdom.				</p>
				
				<p>
<blockquote>“Power evangelism”</blockquote> was demonstrated by our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and it is safe and reasonable to ask for the power when we are on assignment for the kingdom. In Luke 5:17, the Bible says that Jesus was out on the crusade ground preaching and teaching the word of God and the power of the Holy Spirit was present for healings and deliverances. The power of God follows His word wherever the kingdom business is being carried out. That is why one of the channels for the release of power is soul-winning. Whenever we are out to preach for Jesus and win souls or whenever we are standing with someone to witness about Jesus so as to save that soul, the power of the Holy Spirit is backing us up. God never sends a messenger on an errand without empowering him. Are you committed to true evangelism? Then fear not, for the power of the Holy Spirit is with you to do exploits. You have been positioned to win. Rejoice in the Lord.				</p>
