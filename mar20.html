				As a follow–up to yesterday’s exhortation, we need to know the place of calling God by His name. When we come to the presence of the Lord, we must come with thanksgiving because that is the ticket to His presence according to Psalm 100:3 and with
praise, which is the passport into His court. We must not be in such a hurry as to forget that we owe Him thanksgiving for being alive to be able to bring our needs before Him. However, we may have emergency situations when we have only enough time to shout “JESUS” and God will intervene for us, at such times. I once escaped an accident which I saw as unavoidable. But at the shout of JESUS, there was a swift angelic intervention and I can never explain how that accident did not take place.<br /><br />
In the theatre of prayer where we come to spend some time before God, we must move from thanksgiving into worship. This is the act of adoring God, eulogizing Him (if that can be permitted), telling Him who He is and so on. That is where we call God all His names and we mention all His attributes that we can remember. In that context, we call Him the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. The God of Abraham means the God of blessing, the faithful God, the God who never forgets, the God who rewards obedience and faith, the miracle–working God, the Almighty God. Then, we call Him the God of Isaac. That means the God of laughter, the God of multiplication (because God blessed Abraham but He multiplied Isaac by His word in Genesis 22:17), the God of new beginning (Isaac was the beginning of a new covenant generation before God). The God of Isaac is the God who can create something from nothing. Then, we call on the God of Jacob. That is the merciful God, the God of a second chance, the God who turned a man to a nation, the God who magnifies, the God who causes wealth to change hands. When we call on God and worship Him in that fashion, He shows up, and in His presence there is joy forever more.<br /><br />
Our prayer life can be richer if we can draw God’s presence down through quality worship when we call Him the Ancient of days, the Rock of ages, the I Am that I Am, the Bright and Morning Star, the everlasting Father. Therefore, we make our petitions in the name of Jesus. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
