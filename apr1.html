For if by one man's offence 
death reigned

which receive
abundance of graceand 
of the gift of
righteousness shall reign in 
life by one, Jesus Christ.</code></pre>

					We have considered the power of <b>one blessing</b> for sometime in the series on the power of One. The power of One is an issue that is common to both the Old and New Testaments. We shall consider the power of one as it relates to one man or one person today. God created only one man at the beginning. His name was Adam. The Bible calls Him the first Adam. He was the man who sinned against God and lost the divine nature with which he was endowed at the
beginning. All other men and women who would ever live were in the first Adam as a seed. God never created a second person as He did Adam. Whatever God spoke to him, He spoke to all humanity. When God blessed him, all humanity was blessed in him. Therefore, when God cursed him, as a result of his sin, we were all cursed and because we were all in him, we have all been tainted with his sin. Therefore every person who is born from the union of man and woman is born a sinner. All have sinned and lost the glory of God in Adam (Romans 3:23).
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Blessed be God who put the plan of salvation into place in order to give hope of eternal life and the restoration of the original glory of the divine nature to man. God sent another man, the last Adam, (Jesus Christ) to bear the punishment for the sin of the first Adam. What’s unique between the first and the last Adam is that they were both authored by God: God created Adam when He took a piece of the earth and made a man of it and breathed life into it to form Adam; in the case of the last Adam which is Jesus Christ, God’s word was the seed (rather than a man’s seed) by which He was conceived in Mary’s womb. Therefore, He was not tainted by the corruption to which the whole of humanity was subjected as a result of the sin of Adam. The last Adam must be untainted with the sin of the first Adam in order to bear the punishment for sin and get the wrath of God for sin exhausted on Him on the cross. That was the gateway to our salvation. Glory be to God!
					
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The power of One plays out in the divine plan for our salvation. Glory be to God who did not allow me or you to pay for the sin of Adam because we don’t have the capacity to face or endure the eternal punishment for sin. Jesus Christ is the One Man who took our place in the punishment for sin. We are so grateful to Him. Rejoice in the Lord.
