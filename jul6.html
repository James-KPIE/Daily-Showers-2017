            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Luke 4:1-13 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Lk. 4:6</strong> <br>                         
And the devil said unto him, 
All this power will I give 
thee, and the glory of them: 
for that is delivered unto 
me; and to whomsoever I will 
I give it.</code></pre>

				<p>
				We must be careful to make a distinction between our confession of faith and denial of facts. Faith does not deny facts but it acts inspite of those facts so that God may step in and glorify His name. Sometimes, we may also need to act contrary to the line of the fact so that we do not give room to the adversary. And that is what Jesus Christ did in the passage before us today.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The tempter had approached our Lord Jesus to make a mountain out of the event that took place in the garden of Eden when Adam and Eve lost the original glory and permitted satan to have a ride but our Lord Jesus would neither be blackmailed nor intimidated. Our Lord Jesus did not deny satan’s assertion in our memory verse for today. It is a fact of history that cannot be wiped out. Indeed, that is where the journey of our redemption began. It all started at the garden of Eden, not in the garden of Gethsemane. Jesus Christ only went to pray in the second garden in order to obtain a reversal of the repercussions and curses which we inherited when the first Adam fell at Eden. Thank God Jesus Christ was able to surrender to the Father’s will and that is why we can be saved by the work which He did at Calvary.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				I have encountered believers who kept certain issues to themselves which would require other people’s assistance because they believed in the confession of faith. Our God is a miracle working God but if a case requires other people to join faith with you, why not? A brother is in dire need financially and materially and he is dying, when another brother can lend a helping hand! The fact that it is well with your soul does not mean you will never have challenges. None of us is immuned against challenges neither does it mean that you will never have problems again after you have surrendered your life to Christ. The greatest assurance is that if you will abide in Him to the end challenges and trials notwithstanding, you will spend eternity with Him.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We must keep confessing the positive and make our faith declaration day and night, for it carries great power. A student who finds a subject difficult must humble himself to find someone who can help him understand that subject while he goes on confessing success. Confession without action may lead to frustration. Rejoice in the Lord.
