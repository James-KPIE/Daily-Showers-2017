				Year 2017 is winding up. What will count most at the end of this year is not what you have acquired or achieved in 2017 but what level your relationship with your Maker is. We all came from God and unto Him we shall return. The Biblical account of the creation of man proves
beyond all reasonable and unreasonable doubts that there is unity of creation. No one is an accident on earth. None of us is a descendant from an ape. We are created by the predetermined will of God to fulfill a purpose here on earth. Whether we fulfill that purpose, (that is our assignment on earth), depends entirely on each of us. And God did not create us to walk to and fro on the surface of this earth and disappear without adding value to the place that has supported our living and existence. May you fulfill divine purpose in Jesus name. Amen.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				There is an accepted time when we must close the chapter of sin and enter into a chapter of living in holiness unto the Lord. To help us perfect the transition is the reason behind the messages in this devotional since Christmas day. We have taken four days to do an expose on salvation, what it entails and how to get on board the flight that will convey us to the other side of eternity. God has done all He should do. He has sent His only begotten Son to die for your sin. He has raised generational eye-openers to make His word clear to us. He anointed pastors, evangelists, teachers, prophets and apostles fitting into different roles in the body of Christ that they may help you put your life into shape spiritually. His precious promises are waiting for all those who have become His sons and daughters through Christ to claim through prayers. Grace is available for the saved to enable him or her do exploits and command results beyond what he or she is able to do without the help of God. The way of Christ is all gain and no loss. If there is any loss, it is the loss of the status of being a slave to sin and a captive to the devil.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Salvation is not a thing to be postponed. If you postpone salvation today, who tells you that you will be alive tomorrow? If you delay your salvation, you will only delay a life of limitless possibilities in God. There is a portion of blessing unrevealed for those who love God and live according to His purpose. Salvation will put the devil under you as you overcome sin by the blood of Jesus. Give your life to Christ before this year ends. Year 2018 may be too late. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
