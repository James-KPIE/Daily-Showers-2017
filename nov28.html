            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Psalm 50:5-12 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Psalm 24:1</strong> <br>                         
The earth is the LORD'S,
and the fullness thereof;
the world, and they that
dwell therein.</code></pre>

				God owns all things because He created them. By His endowment man is also given creative powers such that we produce other things from the original things God has made. God put minerals inside the earth and He gave intelligence to man. The sun generates
energy which we can tap into and all that. Through constant trials and research man has made great advancement in converting many of God‘s original provisions to end products that serve human good. Scientists have made significant strides in several areas such as engineering, medicine and information technology. All these have made life easier and through medical research some diseases which have claimed so many lives centuries ago have now been kept at bay. In it all we see the invisible hand of God in nature and His divine enabling. It must be acknowledged however that Satan has also manipulated the mind of men and women such that what was useful for the benefit of mankind has been converted to achieve destructive ends. Think about guns, bombs, poisonous materials and evil things on the internet.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Our emphasis today is that God owns all things and He has created us as users and not as owners. The understanding of this truth will ease the destructive pursuits which many men and women have made and are making to the detriment of their souls. The selfish instinct which pushes man to want to continue to acquire more notwithstanding the fact that other people may suffer disadvantages thereby emanated from the wrong thinking of man that he must strive to own as much as possible. When pursued to the logical conclusion, man exceeds what is enough for him and creates scarcity for several other people.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				When God created Adam, He had made the garden ready with all the provisions that Adam would need. However, Adam was only given the garden to manage and not to own. And that is the mind of God for all things that come our way. It is foolishness of thinking for a man to even think that he can own things. Whoever owns a thing has it and controls it forever. Whatever you and I claim to own today is only under our control until death comes. Therefore, whether we like it or not, other people who did not work for them will have them for their use. That is why the Bible regards the pursuit of these ephemeral things as vanity. You hold unto it today and tomorrow they put it in your hand (when you’re dead) and you cannot hold it. Think on this -don’t lose your soul in the pursuit of the ephemeral. Seek and hold unto that which is eternal – the kingdom of God and its righteousness. Rejoice in the Lord.
