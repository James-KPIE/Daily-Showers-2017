And give thee the blessing of Abraham, 
to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that 
thou mayest inherit the land wherein 
thou art a stranger, 
which God gave unto Abraham.</code></pre>

				The covenant which the Lord established with Abraham has become the fountain of all the blessings which we desire of the Lord. The Abrahamic covenant was first a personal covenant but in Genesis 17:19, God made it a generational covenant when He told Abraham that He would establish the covenant with Isaac as an everlasting covenant. In verses 20-21, God deliberately excluded Ishmael from the covenant as He merely
blessed him and spoke fruitfulness and multiplication to Ishmael in verse 20 only to reiterate in verse 21 that He would establish His covenant with Isaac. This was confirmed by the Lord in Genesis 22:2.<br /><br />
Abraham is our reference point for the blessing. In Genesis 12:2, God declared to Abraham that he shall be a blessing. That is, beyond being blessed personally, others would be blessed who got connected to him. The Hebrews did, but blessed be the Lord that through Christ Jesus the Gentiles have also connected to the blessing of Abraham. We shall dwell on that tomorrow.<br /><br />
The words which Isaac spoke to Jacob in our scripture reading for today show us the uniqueness of the blessing as a token of divine impartation. Towards the end of Genesis 27, Jacob was advised by Rebecca to leave home and go and stay with Laban her elder brother for a few days until the anger of Esau, who had threatened to kill Jacob, subsided. At the beginning of chapter 28, Jacob prepared to take off on that journey. His father rose up to bless his journey. Then in verse 3 of Genesis 28 he spoke specific blessings into Jacob’s life. As if those were not enough, he ended up by specifically pronouncing the blessing of Abraham on him in verse 4. It was as if the earlier prayers were a wish, for they did not rest upon the foundation of the blessing of Abraham. It is very important for us to understand this root because in Isaiah 51:2, God Himself directed us to pattern our lives after Abraham so we could access the kind of blessing He gave to him. Abraham is our reference point in the blessing covenant. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
