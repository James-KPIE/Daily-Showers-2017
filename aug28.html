            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: John 15:16</strong> <br>                         
Ye have not chosen
me, but I have chosen
you, and ordained
you, that ye should go
and bring forth fruit,
and that your fruit
should remain: that
whatsoever ye shall
ask of the Father
in my name, he
may give it you.</code></pre>

				<p>One major profit of getting engrossed in the business of soul-winning is answered prayers. It does not appear that all believers have made this discovery. Otherwise, our churches would be full on those days that we set aside for evangelism. Unfortunately, in many churches many Christians would have nothing to do with evangelism and soul-winning. To invite an unchurched person in the neighbourhood to church is even a very difficult task for many adherents. A pastor was full of regrets sometime ago when his own blood sister rose up in the church to give testimony of how God
delivered her from barrenness. It was a gathering of over a million people. The pastor was a minister in a branch of the church but he had never invited his sister to programmes in the church. He was shocked when his sister went out to give her testimony. She even said that her brother who is a pastor in the church had never invited her but one member of the church did and the Lord answered her prayer, terminated her barrenness and gave her a child
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Jesus Christ encouraged us not only to win souls but to follow them up and disciple them. As those souls begin to count for the expansion of the kingdom, God will begin to answer your prayers with greater frequency. God has His favourites whether we want to believe it or not. I know so from the scriptures. There are those who ask and receive. They are on the automatic frequency. There are those who must do more to get their desires realized, for example, they may need to knock or even seek. These ones will do more than the first category. God reserves rapid response for His favourites who are sold out in the service of the kingdom. In Isaiah 65:24, we see God’s heart for them. It reads: <blockquote>“And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer, and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.”</blockquote>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				God’s favourites are those who have no greater or higher priority above the kingdom business. Even as they do their own business, their own business is also a platform for carrying out the great commission. Those who are sold out to God, who win souls and nurture them until they are established, have qualified to be treated as the favourites of the Almighty God. That is what we find in Psalm 102:13-14. God is committed to answer their prayers according to the words of our Lord Jesus Christ. Rejoice in the Lord.
