				Those who trust absolutely in God will always enjoy His help and support. Delay can come because of inability to trust in God. The first reason why people fail to trust in God is because they don’t have a solid relationship with Him. So, when they pray they are unsure whether an answer would come. It is much more worrisome if sin is in the heart of
the person who prays. Proverbs 15:8 says that the sacrifice of the sinner is an abomination to God. The psalmist also wrote in Psalm 66:18 that God would not hear his prayers if he regarded iniquity in his heart. A sinner cannot trust in the holy God but if he repents God will forgive him and then he will enter into a personal relationship whereby he can trust in God.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				To trust in God means to abandon your life into His hands as you believe absolutely in His promises which He has made to you. But to trust in God, you must accept His plans for your life for when you work at cross–purposes with Him, trust cannot work. You need to accept the path the Lord charts for you and walk in it however it may be. If you trust in God, you may have to accept your situation when things do not turn out well. If you trust in God, you will not complain in the hours of difficulty, knowing that all things will eventually work out for your good. Meshach, Shadrach and Abednego did not complain when they faced the fiery furnace. Daniel too did not grumble when he was to be thrown into the lion’s den. Their trust was in the Lord and He delivered them.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				When trust is demonstrated, God responds by stepping out on our behalf either to send a blessing to us or to defend us or to deal with the enemy. Trust requires an absolute, unshaken confidence in God’s preparedness to act on our behalf. The three Hebrew boys told the king that much as the king gave the final orders for them to be thrown into the fiery furnace. It was as if the Hebrew boys spoke out the words in Isaiah 50:7 which says <b>“For I know that the Lord God will help me; therefore I shall not be confounded. Therefore I have set my eyes as a flint; and I know I shall not be ashamed.”</b> God did not delay to come into the situation of those boys just as He went into the lions’ den before Daniel got there. It is in our interest to trust absolutely in God. May be you have suffered delay for lack of trust in God even though you claim to be a Christian. No one can help you to trust in God. You must do it by yourself and you will escape shame. Rejoice in the Lord.
