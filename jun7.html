            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Exo. 34:14</strong> <br>                         
For thou shalt
worship no other
god: for the LORD,
whose name is
Jealous, is a
jealous God:</code></pre>


			<div align="justify">
				<p>
				Worship is an act of acknowledgement of the One to whom we belong. It is not an act which we do secretly. For the believer, it is such a joy to express our worship to the Almighty God when we gather in fellowship as we relish the joy of coming into His
presence. The act of open worship helped Daniel to prove that he
truly belonged to Yahweh when he was in Babylon as a captive. Everyone around Daniel knew that he would not compromise the worship of the Almighty God. It was his holy practice right from his youth (Daniel 6:10). The adversaries of Daniel confirmed that Daniel did his worship and prayed three times a day. However, the king who did not actually desire that Daniel would be mauled by the lions even prayed for Daniel as he was thrown into the den of lions according to Daniel 6:16 when he said: “May your God whom you serve continually deliver you.” And that God answered the prayers of the king for Daniel.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				I wonder what could have happened to Daniel if he had abandoned the worship of the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the land of captivity. Our worship causes God to turn to us as our Defence because we have demonstrated that we belong to Him. He is a jealous God in two senses. In the first place, He would not have us give the glory that belongs to Him to graven images or any lesser mortal. Secondly, He is jealous over us and He wants to jealously guide and protect us as the apple of His eyes. In Deuteronomy 32:1-(b) the scripture says that the Lord cared for Jacob and kept him as the apple of His eye. In Psalm 74:19-20 we read the Psalmist’s plea for the preservation of the Lord’s favourite, that is the one who belongs to Him. “Do not deliver the soul of your dove to the wild beasts; do not forget the life of your poor forever. Have regard for the covenant, for the dark places of the earth are filled with habitations of cruelty.” True worshippers are those who keep covenant with the Lord. And the covenant ensures both the blessings which God showers on those who worship Him and keep His covenant through obedience. Meshach, Shadrach, Abednego and Daniel were in that company.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Are you an unashamed worshipper of God? Does everything in your life give glory to God? Would you rather displease man than fail to worship God and be ready to face the consequences? Let us learn from Daniel and his colleagues. Worship proves that we belong to God. Rejoice in the Lord.
