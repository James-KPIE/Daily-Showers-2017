				The Bible says concerning the righteous in Christ who is connected to the blessing of Abraham, that he is surrounded with favour as a shield (Psalm 5:12). When a man enjoys favour with the Lord, people make way for him on the earth. Abraham was highly favoured and so was Isaac. When the anointing for
favour rests upon a man, it does not matter how thick the opposition is, he will emerge successful in whatever he does. It is the favour of God that enables a man to do well where other people are complaining of unfavourable circumstances. In Genesis 26:1-16 we saw how Isaac listened to God and stayed back in Gerah to sow his seed in a season of famine and the Lord prospered him to the envy of a whole nation. Isaac’s uncommon achievements and breakthroughs left the Philistines wondering at Isaac as they could not unravel how a single man gained so much financial dominion from the land where the people were struggling for survival. The blessing distinguished Isaac.<br /><br />
Divine favour singles a man out for a blessing among a multitude. Favour does not come by merit. It is a product of divine sovereignty. Psalm 115:3 says that our Lord God is in the heavens and He does as He pleases. In 1 Samuel 2:7, the Bible says: “He maketh poor, and maketh rich; He bringeth low, and lifteth up.” In Ecclesiastes 9:11, the word of this our incomprehensible God says that to be rich is not a matter of brilliance neither does victory come from the strength of the man in the battle but everything is a function of opportunity and God is the “Creator” and “Decider” of opportunities. When He said that He loved Jacob and hated Esau, it was just a piece of His mind expressing His supreme choice. He backs you up if you find favour with Him and if you don’t find favour with Him, good luck to you, as they say. The God who shows favour is sovereign.<br /><br />
It does not end there however, because redemption means God has divinely arranged to predestine us for favour among all the people He has created upon the earth. We will never know how He made us (the redeemed) the objects of His love. We are saved because He has made us His beloved through grace. None of us qualifies to be saved. We are eternally grateful for His favour that we enjoy. Rejoice in the Lord.<br /><br />
