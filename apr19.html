And thine ears shall hear a word behind
thee, saying, This is
the way, walk ye in it,
when ye turn to the
right hand, and when
ye turn to the left.

					The word of God is the instrument by which God conveys His mind to us. God has been speaking to man since man was created and He still speaks. The problem with us is that we do not always hear Him when He speaks. Many people who are Christians do not care to take their relationship with God to the level of conversational
relationship as Abraham and David did. God speaks to those who listen with their heart because that is the place which communicates with God. In Psalm 27:8, David wrote an account of a conversation he had with God, thus: “when thou saidst, ‘seek my face;’ my heart said unto thee, thy face, Lord, will I seek.” God also watches our hearts to respond to the requests we make with our mouth. That is why we must ensure that the state of our heart is alright with God.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The Bible emphasizes the power of one word when God blesses us or when He gives us instructions in righteousness. In Psalm 107:20, the Bile says: God sent His word and healed them and delivered them from destruction. Just one word is enough for your deliverance. The Centurion who met Jesus in Luke 7 was a wise man. He told Jesus to send His word only and he believed that his servant would get well and Jesus marveled at his faith. In our Bible reading today, the instruction given was that the people would hear a word behind, giving direction. When God wants to draw men out of the sinful world unto Himself, His word is simple. He says “Come…” (Isaiah 1:18 and Matthew 11:28). If you are able to turn to Him, salvation, deliverance and rest become your portion. At times when the word of blessing comes to people, they wonder that the words are few. If you come to a pastor to pray for you and he just says to you: <blockquote>“you are blessed" or "God bless you"</blockquote>, you feel you need more. However, if the Lord seals those few words unto performance, your destiny will never remain the same.
				</p>

					Watch out for the single word in different places in the Bible. In marriage, we are told to love. To receive, you are instructed to give. To enjoy a harvest of increase, you are told to sow your seed. From every sin and lust of the flesh, you are warned to flee. When you are offended, you are to forgive. One word can be powerful. Rejoice in the Lord.
