            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Deut. 28:23</strong> <br>                         
And thy heaven
that is over thy head
shall be brass, and
the earth that is
under thee shall be
iron.</code></pre>

				Another reason why God may be silent is when the heavens have been shut by Him due to the disobedience of His people. Most times, the acts of God are preceded by His word. He speaks to His prophets to communicate His mind to His people. During the war
campaigns under Joshua, the nation of Israel would take
instructions from God as to how to proceed in battle against the nations which were to be dislodged from the Promised Land. There were times when Israel fought against those nations and at other times, they were not to fight. For example when they were to cross over to Jordan, they had to face Jericho and bring down the strong and tall walls of Jericho. The instruction which God gave to Joshua was not to fight but to go round the walls once for six days, engaging the trumpets before the ark. On the seventh day, they were to go round the city seven times with a great shout after the long blast of the trumpet and the wall would fall down flat. And it was so. Israel won battles as they followed God’s instruction under open heavens.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				When the heaven is shut, divine instruction is scarce and people are left to engage the strength of the flesh which cannot carry them far. When the heaven is shut, divine favour, divine support and divine partnership will be lacking. Under heavens that are shut, success is hard to achieve and progress is impeded. The end result of shut heavens is stagnation. When heavens are shut, the weapons of war will not avail. In Psalm 78:9-10, the Bible says: <blockquote>“The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. They did not keep the covenant of God; they refused to walk in His law.”</blockquote> When they broke the covenant which their forefathers had with God, their heavens were shut and the confidence to enter into battle was lost and they turned back in fear of their foes.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				As we observed yesterday, if the heaven is shut and God is silent, the way out is not to walk out on God as Saul did. Our God is sovereign. All power belongs to Him. We need Him much more than He needs us. Our success depends on Him and without Him, we can do nothing. Therefore, what we must do is to keep asking for His mercy and do the works of repentance if the heaven is shut. Rejoice in the Lord.
				</p>
