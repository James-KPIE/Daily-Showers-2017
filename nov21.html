            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Lk. 22:27</strong> <br>                         
For whether is greater, he 
that sitteth at meat, or he 
that serveth? is not he that 
sitteth at meat? but I am 
among you as he that serveth.</code></pre>

				To our Lord Jesus Christ a leader should serve and not be served. This was one of Christ’s counter-cultural teachings which did not go down well with the synagogue priests and the religious leaders of His days when He was here on the earth in the body. As it is in many parts of the world today the influential and the rich want to be served and
to lord it over the less privileged ones around them. Yet our Lord Jesus
took an exception to that and said that leaders are to serve and empower those who are around them to serve as well. He did exactly that for and with His disciples.
<br /><br />
Imagine how the morale of your workers would be kept at optimal level if you relate to them as one of them rather than as a superior boss who is emotionally detached and untouched by what they pass through in their normal daily lives. Jesus Christ is touched even by our infirmities. He feels pains when we are in pains. In fact He went to the cross to endure pains so we shall not be in pains. He came down from the throne of His glory to identify with us physically and emotionally, but not sinfully. In order to identify with us in our helplessness in sin, He died for us offering His life that we may live. You will recall the seven supernatural exchanges that He carried out on the cross so as to identify with those seven principal areas of our lives. Emotionally, He wept at the tomb of Lazarus.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The leadership style of Jesus is the type that has time to stay with the sheep and attend to their needs. When the mother-in-law of Peter was ill in Peter’s house, Jesus healed her first before doing any other thing. There are bosses who never sympathized with their subordinates if the latter have obvious challenges. How can a considerate boss refuse to grant permission to a junior worker whose wife is rushed to the hospital for an emergency operation? How can a worker concentrate at work if his wife’s life is at risk in a surgical theatre? .
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<b>Great leaders know that the worker comes before the work so they do whatever they can within available resources to make the worker comfortable.</b> I have a friend who did everything in his power to get his driver to own a house in South-West Nigeria. I want to imitate him and do likewise. There is no greatness in being a harsh and heartless boss. If you are one, repent today. Be a leader and not just a boss. Rejoice in the Lord.
