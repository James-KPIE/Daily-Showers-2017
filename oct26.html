            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Matt. 15:26</strong> <br>                         
But he answered and said, It 
is not meet to take the 
children's bread, and to 
cast it to dogs.</code></pre>

				<p>
				The encounter of Jesus Christ with the Syro–phoenician woman strikes on the note of the faith of a Gentile who got a miracle which the Jews believed are reserved for them. It appears that Jesus stretched the woman’s faith and her ability to persist. There is no one who came to Jesus in the Bible and worshipped Him without having his or her request granted. She got Jesus to change His no to yes through worship.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The word of our Lord Jesus Christ in our memory verse is the focus of our attention today. And this is a follow–up to the message of yesterday. Believers have become kingdom citizens by virtue of redemption. We are no longer limited by the forces that rule this world such as occultic forces or the economic forces. We are connected to the heavenly economy by virtue of the price which Jesus Christ paid on the cross. He lived short that we may live long. He became poor so that we may be rich through His poverty. He received the stripes for our healing. By His chastisement, He won peace for us. His cross was the cross of exchange. What all of these mean for us is that we are not ordinary persons on this earth. We are connected to the supernatural by the redemption we receive through His blood. We share divine nature as a result of the work on the cross and we are victorious by the resurrection of Christ. The name of Jesus has become a power of attorney for us to petition heaven and obtain divine intervention. Is it not amazing that we have the privilege to provoke heaven to do certain things as we desire it here on earth if we tap into the power of two according to Matthew 18:19? And so much more.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We will stop experiencing delay in our journey through life in many areas when we begin to walk in the consciousness of our redemptive status. Many Christians still beg on the altar of prayer where they should issue command. Prayer should be bold on our lips as we seek to defend our status in redemption if there is any violation of our redemptive rights. John 1:12 establishes the truth that we have the power of sonship. And that power is what gives us the supernatural advantage over all the works and workers of darkness. We don’t deny that they exist but Jesus has given us victory over them by His death and resurrection. We are not the underdog in any spiritual battle. The Almighty God is our backbone. His power is still available for us. We should draw Him into all our battles by faith and be fully persuaded of victory. We are more than conquerors. Miracles are like bread for God’s children in His kingdom. Rejoice in the Lord.
