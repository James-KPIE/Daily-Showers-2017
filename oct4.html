            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Numbers 12:1-10 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Num. 12:10</strong> <br>                         
And the cloud departed from 
off the tabernacle; and, 
behold, Miriam became leprous, 
white as snow: and Aaron 
looked upon Miriam, and, 
behold, she was leprous.</code></pre>

				We are still considering the reasons why men and women may suffer delay in the pursuit of their life missions and purposes. One of the reasons why a person, even a Christian may miss the favour of God which creates room and gives speed of accomplishment to men and women is when the person insults a servant of God. David knew that and it helped him to benefit from the Lord’s mercy and
compassion. Even when he could have killed king Saul in retaliation when he found him unprotected in a cave, he merely cut off the edge of the dress of Saul. That harmless action brought him pain of guilt later on as he regretted going that far even against a man who had attempted to kill him and was still bent on doing so when David found him unprotected. Recall that David even ordered that the man who ran to him to break the news of the death of Saul in order to take the credit should be killed. David was angry that the man had the audacity to feel confident to announce the tragedy that befell the anointed of the Lord.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The confrontation of Miriam and Aaron against Moses was not tolerated by God who punished Miriam instantly with leprosy. Aaron’s punishment was a shameful death on the mountain. All those sentences which God passed on them posed serious setbacks to destiny of the conspirators. You will recall that those who got involved in the rebellion of Kohath, Dathan and Abiram in Numbers 16 were all buried alive as the Lord commanded the earth to open and swallow them up. In 2 Samuel 6:16, Michal the daughter of Saul, David’s wife despised David when he danced unashamedly before God to celebrate the recovery of the ark of God but she paid dearly for her insult as she became barren for life (v. 23).

				<p>
				<b>Every man who is called by God is answerable to God and God knows how to handle His erring servant.</b> The safest path to tread is the path of humility even when we have observations to make in respect of what a servant of the Lord does. Our primary obligation is to pray for the servant of the Lord on daily basis. I pray regularly for the servant of the Lord who presides over our organization that the spirit of error would be far from him, apart from other prayers. If the servant of the Lord goes wrong and you make your observation known in a gentle manner without causing a stir or sparking the fire of rebellion, then continue to pray to God who knows how best to deal with those He has called. In that way you will not bring God’s wrath upon yourself and your family. Rejoice in the Lord.
