            <h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Psalm 23 </h3>
            <pre><code><strong style="color:red">M. V: Ps. 57:2</strong> <br>                         
I will cry unto God most 
high; unto God that 
performeth all things for me.</code></pre>

				David prospered through understanding. He walked with God and knew God’s heart for him. The unfavourable circumstances at the beginning of his life pushed him to the Almighty God and he stayed with Him and was mightily blessed by God. David did
not give up because of his background. He grew his faith to believe that what man could not do for him God would do and that is the pillar of understanding which we shall consider today–the understanding that God is your Source. That is the opening verse of Psalm 23 which has been interpreted as saying <b>God is my Source, I shall not lack resources.</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				It is pertinent to believe as we mentioned yesterday, that God wants you to do well. From Genesis to Revelation, the plan and purpose of God for those who serve Him are well spelt out. The prophesies and the promises are too overwhelming for us to miss out on the incontrovertible conclusion that God is committed to the prosperity of His own people and that includes our physical well–being as well as spiritual wellness. Isaiah 45:19 makes it more convincing. It is not in vain that we serve Him. Jesus Christ confirmed that position in Matthew 19:27-29 when Peter asked what was in it for those who had left all to serve Him. Our Lord and Saviour mentioned both the immediate and eternal blessings and that is what we should believe as we commit ourselves to labouring with our hands so that we can use that medium as a window for the blessings of heaven to come in (Psalm 1:3).
				</p>
				
				<p>
				God is your Source. You can repeat that to yourself until it needs not to be mentioned again because it has become a part of your mentality. Please note that your career or certificate is not your source. Your husband is not your source though you are homemaker (housewife). Your employer is not your source though the company pays your salary, provides accommodation for you and does more. There may be channels through which you are blessed materially but only GOD is your Source. That was Abraham’s explanation to the king of Salem in Genesis 14:20-23. If those who are blessing you are wise in God, they will also acknowledge that God has given them the privilege to do so, so that this same God who is also their own Source can bless them the more. That is the whole truth. Rejoice in the Lord.
